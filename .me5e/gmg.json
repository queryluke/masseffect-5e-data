Below you'll\nfind a list of mechanics used in this system.</p>\n<h3>Rule exception/addition</h3>\n<p>The first step is deciding what you want your mechanic to do, e.g. add health, shields, or damage; provide advantage on\nsaving throws, etc. <strong>We strongly recommend that you do not make new mechanics that increase the combat effectiveness of ranged weapons.\nThese mechanics should be reserved for weapon mods.</strong></p>\n<h3>Potency</h3>\n<p>Next, decide how the mechanic's potency will stack. For example, increased shield points have 5 points per potency.\nSo, an Armor Mod with +10 shield points would have a potency of 2. Armor Mods should never have a potency higher than 3.\nKeep this in mind when figuring out the lowest potency amount.</p>\n<h3>Cost</h3>\n<p>Figuring out the cost is mostly guesswork. Low-cost mechanics have minor combat applications, such as additional\ncarrying capacity or minor speed boosts. These range from 1,000 to 5,000 credits. Mods that increase survivability\n(shields, AC, resistances) or damage should range between 5,000 and 20,000 credits</p>\n<h3>List of Mechanics</h3>\n<v-simple-table class=\"mb-8\"><template v-slot:default><thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Rule Exception</th>\n<th>Potency</th>\n<th>Cost per Potency</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Increase AC</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>20000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>reroll any 1 and 2 on your (biotic, tech, or melee) damage rolls</td>\n<td>1 damage type</td>\n<td>40000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Advantage on skill check</td>\n<td>1 skill type</td>\n<td>15000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>+X to melee weapon attack and damage rolls</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>12000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Use medi-gel as a reaction to taking hit point damage</td>\n<td>1 medi-gel charge</td>\n<td>8000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Instantly stabilize when you drop below 0 hit points.</td>\n<td>1 per long rest</td>\n<td>35000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>When subjected to an effect that lets you make a saving throw to take half damage, take no damage on a success.</td>\n<td>1 saving throw type</td>\n<td>45000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Increases one ability score by 1-5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>33000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Condition Immunity</td>\n<td>1 condition</td>\n<td>35000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>reroll any 1 on your (biotic, tech, or melee) damage rolls</td>\n<td>1 damage type</td>\n<td>20000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Damage immunity</td>\n<td>1 damage type</td>\n<td>55000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Darkvision up to certain distance.

    "html": "<p>An armor set can be one or many pieces of armor. Armor sets are cheaper than creating custom armor, even though they\nmay be more powerful. The justification is that an armor set is mass manufactured, so you get more benefits at the\nexpense of not being able to customize the armor with additional mods.</p>\n<p>First, decide the type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) and which pieces it will contain. Then find the base\ncost by using the costs defined in the creating armor table. Next, decide what mechanics (and their potency) you want\nto add to the armor. Calculate the total cost of all your mechanics, add it to the base cost of your armor piece.</p>\n<p>Next, you can decide if there are benefits for wearing multiple pieces of the armor. Benefits\ncan be mechanics (with a potency) or a unique mechanic. Calculate the total of the of all set bonuses and\ndistribute that total evenly across the armor pieces.</p>\n<p>Finally, with all costs calculated, reduce the total amount of each armor piece by 15%.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set Bonus (2 of 2)\n<ul>\n<li>+10 Shields = potency 2 = 10,000 * 2.5 = 25,000</li>\n<li>+1 AC = potency 1 = 20,000 (<em>Note that set bonus mechanic costs per potency do not take the other pieces into account</em>)</li>\n<li><strong>Subtotal</strong>: 45,000</li>\n<li>Divide set bonus by number of pieces: 45,000 / 2 = 22,500</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Set Piece 1\n<ul>\n<li>Medium Body Armor = 16,000 (Chest = 10,000, Arms = 3,000, Legs = 3,000)</li>\n<li>Mechanics = AC +2 = potency 2 = 20,000 * 2.5 = 50,000</li>\n<li>Set Bonus = 22,500</li>\n<li>Subtotal: 88,500</li>\n<li><strong>Total</strong>: 88,500 - (88,500 * .15) =  75,225</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Set Piece 2\n<ul>\n<li>Medium Head = 5,000</li>\n<li>Mechanics = Darkvision, toggled as a free action = potency 1 = 2,000 + slight increase for free action = 3,000</li>\n<li>Set Bonus = 22,500</li>\n<li>Subtotal: 30,500\n<strong>Total</strong>: 30,500 - (30,500 * .15) =  25,925</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When creating armor sets, the cost is just a rule of thumb.

    "section": "vehicle-creation",
    "order": 1,
    "html": "<p>The Vehicle List above provides a short list of vehicle examples for you to use in your campaign. However, it is\nencouraged that you and/or your GM create vehicles of their own to use in your campaign. Use the following guidelines\nwhen creating your vehicle.</p>\n<h3>Create a concept</h3>\n<p>First, you'll want to create a concept for your vehicle. What is its main purpose (defense, offense, transport, smuggling, etc)?\nWhat species are associated with the vehicle? Is it unique or mass produced? What does it look like? What size is it?</p>\n<p>If you're looking for inspiration, check out <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/euderion/gallery/40849119/MASS-EFFECT\" target=\"_blank\">Euderion's vehicle creations on DeviantArt</a>.</p>\n<h3>Name</h3>\n<p>Next, you'll need a good name for your vehicle. Mass produced vehicles typically have some sort of manufacturing number\ncombined with a codename or nickname. If your vehicle is a unique creation, it might have a symbolic name.</p>\n<h3>Vehicle Type</h3>\n<p>The vehicle type should be either <strong>transport</strong> or <strong>starship</strong>. If you've selected transport, designate which\ntransport type it is: <strong>land</strong>, <strong>sea</strong>, <strong>air</strong>, or <strong>space</strong>. Some transports can have multiple types.</p>\n<h3>Size</h3>\n<p>If you're creating a transport, choose the size from standard sizes: Medium, Large, Huge, Gargantuan. For starships,\nchoose one of Frigate, Cruiser, Carrier, or Dreadnought.</p>\n<h3>Speed</h3>\n<p>A vehicles speed is somewhat abstract. Mechanically, it represents the number of playmat spaces it can move in one turn.\nThis assumes the vehicle is moving an average pace and slow enough to turn and maneuver. Speed should range from 1 to 15.</p>\n<h3>Range</h3>\n<p>For transports, range is the number of kilometers the vehicle can travel within 24 hours. This calculation should also\ntake its battery or fuel capacity into account.</p>\n<p>For starships, the range is calculated as ftlu (faster than light units). Essentially how many Mass Effect Relay jumps\nor system to system travel it can complete in 24 hours.</p>\n<h3>Cargo</h3>\n<p>How many tonnes can the ship carry? Try thinking about how many mid-size cars can fit into the vehicle or the vehicle tow,\nthis is its Cargo capacity.</p>\n<h3>Cost</h3>\n<p>What is the market rate of the vehicle? It might be that the vehicle is military and not sold on the open market.</p>\n<h3>AC</h3>\n<p>How durable is your vehicle's armor? Or how difficult is it to hit? ACs for vehicles generally range from 10 - 25.</p>\n<h3>HP &amp; SP</h3>\n<p>Use the following table to find the average hull points and shield points. You should adjust the average based on the\nconcept of your vehicle. Was it made for defense? Add more HP. Does it has a state-of-the-art drive, add more SP.</p>\n<v-simple-table class=\"mb-8\"><template v-slot:default><thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>HP</th>\n<th>SP</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Transport</td>\n<td>150</td>\n<td>50</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frigate</td>\n<td>1200</td>\n<td>250</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cruiser</td>\n<td>2000</td>\n<td>500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Carrier</td>\n<td>3500</td>\n<td>750</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dreadnought</td>\n<td>6000</td>\n<td>1500</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</template></v-simple-table><h3>Systems</h3>\n<p>Next, you'll want to decide how many systems your vehicle has. You can either make combined systems (for smaller vehicles)\nor have individual systems (for large starships). A system might be so advanced that it requires multiple crew member to\nmaintain.</p>\n<h3>Crew</h3>\n<h4>Minimum</h4>\n<p>To find the minimum crew, add the number of crew needed for each of the systems.</p>\n<h4>Maximum</h4>\n<p>The maximum crew is generally based on the size of the vehicle</p>\n<v-simple-table class=\"mb-8\"><template v-slot:default><thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Max Crew</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>2-3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>6-8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>10-20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frigate</td>\n<td>20-30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cruiser</td>\n<td>30-100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Carrier</td>\n<td>100-1000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dreadnought</td>\n<td>1000+</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</template></v-simple-table><h3>Weapons</h3>\n<p>Decide what weapons are equipped on the vehicle. For transports, damage rolls are multiplied by 10 and by 100 for\nstarships. It's also ok for the vehicle to have no weapons.</p>\n<h3>CR</h3>\n<p>To calculate the CR, you'll need access to the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating table in the Dungeon Master's\nGuide, pg. 274.</p>\n<h4>Offensive CR</h4>\n<p>First, find the offensive CR by calculating the average of all the damaging attacks. If this is a starship, additionally\ndivide the average by 10. Then find the CR associated with that damage on the Monster Stats table.</p>\n<h4>Defensive CR</h4>\n<p>Next, find the defensive CR by adding the hull point and shield points together. If this is a starship, additionally,\ndivide the sum by 10. Then find the CR associated with that hit point value on the Monster Stats table. If the AC\nis greater than the AC on the Monster Stats table, increase the defensive CR by 1 for every 2 points above the target AC.</p>\n<h4>Final CR</h4>\n<p>The final CR is the average of the offensive and defensive CR, rounded up. If this is for a starship, notate a <strong>+</strong> symbol\nbeside the CR.</p>\n<h4>Transport example:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>AC: 20</li>\n<li>HP: 250</li>\n<li>SP: 0</li>\n<li>Attacks: 35 &amp; 55</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Offensive CR = (35 + 55) / 2 = 45</strong>, corresponds with a CR of 7</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive CR = 250 + 0 = 250</strong>, corresponds with a CR of 12. However, the target AC for CR 12 is only 17. So the final Defensive\nCR becomes 13 (+1 because the AC is 20).</p>\n<p><strong>Final CR = (13 + 7) / 2 = 10</strong></p>\n<h4>Starship example:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>AC: 25</li>\n<li>HP: 2500</li>\n<li>SP: 600</li>\n<li>Attack: 1100 &amp; 900</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Offensive CR = ((1100 + 900) / 2) / 10 = 100</strong>, corresponds with a CR of 16</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive CR = (2500 + 600) / 10 = 310</strong>, corresponds with a CR of 16. However, the target AC for CR 16 is only 18. So the final Defensive\nCR becomes 19 (+3 because the AC is 25).</p>\n<p><strong>Final CR = (16 + 19) / 2 = 17.5 = 18+</strong></p>\n<h3>Additional Details</h3>\n<p>Finally, write a short description about your vehicle and notate if it has any special abilities, additional systems,\nor available system slots.</p>\n",
