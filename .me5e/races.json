    "html": "<p>Asari are a race of elegant, mono-gendered humanoids. The asari resemble female humans with blue or purple skin and a\ncrest of rigid tentacles in place of hair. Despite their feminine appearance, asari have little use for gender or\ngender roles, though they often use female pronouns and gendered language. They possess a unique method of reproduction\ninitiated by a &quot;mind meld&quot; which links the asari's nervous system with a partner-even one of a different race-to\nrandomize genes to create asari offspring. Asari have an innate biotic ability and don't require a biotic implant to\nmanipulate mass effect fields.</p>\n<h2>Unmatched Patience</h2>\n<p>Because of their long lifespan, asari tend to have a &quot;long view&quot; not common in other races. When they encounter a new\nspecies or situation, the asari are more comfortable with an extended period of passive observation and study than immediate action.\nThey invite new species of advanced development to join the galactic community, knowing that their ideals and beliefs will\ninevitably influence the existing culture.</p>\n<h2>Mothers of the Galaxy</h2>\n<p>Asari reproduction is very different from other forms of sexual reproduction. When a meld for reproduction is initiated, the\nasari accesses her partner's genes and subconsciously uses them as an algorithmic seed to remap genes into a unique set of DNA.\nThe offspring resulting from such interspecies pairings are always asari as no DNA is taken from the partner. Instead,\nthe asari uses the meld to explore her partner's genetic heritage and pass desirable traits on to any offspring and\nas a &quot;map&quot; to randomize the genes of the offspring.</p>\n<p>Asari believe that their offspring acquire the best qualities of the &quot;father&quot; from the melded genes. Therefore, they frown\nupon intraspecies conception, since genetic traits and cultural insight is gained from mating outside their species, so\nit's considered wasteful for asari to reproduce together. The results of such unions are occasionally referred to as\n&quot;purebloods&quot;, a great insult among contemporary asari. A rare genetic defect known as Ardat-Yakshi, which makes\nasari destroy the partner's mind during melding, occurs much more frequently among the daughters of purebloods.</p>\n<h2>Maiden, Matron, Matriarch</h2>\n<p>Asari pass through three climacteric life stages, marked by biochemical and physiological changes. The <strong>Maiden</strong> stage\nbegins at puberty and is marked by the drive to explore and experience. Most young asari are curious and restless, and\nit is not uncommon for many to try their hand at dancing in bars or working as mercenaries during this time. The <strong>Matron</strong>\nstage of life begins around the age of 350, though it can be triggered earlier if the individual melds frequently. This\nperiod is marked by a desire to settle in one area and raise children. The <strong>Matriarch</strong> stage begins around 700 years\nof age, or earlier if the individual melds rarely. Matriarchs become active in their community as sages and councilors,\ndispensing wisdom from centuries of experience. Their knowledge and guidance may be one reason why Matriarchs are rarely seen outside asari space.\nHowever, each stage can be started whenever an asari feels that she has reached the correct level of maturity.</p>\n<h2>Asari Names</h2>\n<p>Asari are given a personal name by their parents and take the surname of their mothers, even if the child has 2 asari\nparents. Outside of asari communities, they normally do not use their surnames and prefer to introduce themselves with\ntheir personal name only.

Their thoughts can be compared to a program or process which systematically follows steps to come\nto a conclusion, run many times in different ways until the geth comes to a consensus of the correct course of action.\nGeth do not experience emotion or desire - not in the same way a humanoid does, anyway. Additionally, due to their\ninnate ability to network with other geth, geth see themselves as a unit of a larger and more complex whole and even\nthe individual processes that make up a single geth as being equal constituents that contribute to that geth unit.</p>\n<h2>Beyond the Veil</h2>\n<p>Geth primarily remain in the Perseus Veil: huge nebula of opaque gas and dust that separates geth space from the\nTerminus Systems. They live in peace, but some geth find themselves seeking knowledge of what is beyond their realm.\nThe primary motivation of the geth who leave Rannoch is to acquire and compile information, though some geth pursue other\nquests.</p>\n<h2>Geth Names</h2>\n<p>Geth have no use for names among themselves but will adopt names for the sake of interacting with other races.\nHowever, the geth do not often see themselves as individuals. Many geth use plural pronouns such as &quot;us&quot; and &quot;we&quot;.\nAs a result, the names geth take are normally synonyms or words for groups. Geth with individuality, especially those\nwho have been separated from their kind for an extended time, do exist. Those geth still use words for names, though\nthey give themselves a more personally fitting name.</p>\n<p><strong>Geth Names</strong>: Armada, Army, Batallion, Brigade, Cabal, Caucus, Congregate, Coterie, Guild, Horde, Host, Legion, Myriad, Phalanx, Proletariat, Throng, Troop, Union</p>\n<p><strong>'Individual' Geth Names</strong>: Alpha, Apex, Beta, Centurion, Enigma, Eternity, Genesis, Obelisk, Oblivion, Omega, Oracle, Pinnacle, Terminus, Vortex, Zenith</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"4-5\" source=\"races\" :additional=\"[{source: 'wiki', pages: 'Geth'}]\"></source-reference></p>\n"

Hanar are known for their strong religious beliefs regarding the Protheans, whom they call &quot;the Enkindlers&quot;.\nHanar are extremely polite, almost to a fault. They never refer to themselves in the first person with someone they know\non a face name basis: to do so is considered egotistical. Instead, they refer to themselves as &quot;this one,&quot; or the\nimpersonal &quot;it.&quot; Even when flustered or angry, a hanar will still maintain exquisite poise and will remain formal even\nwith those it wishes dead.</p>\n<h2>Enkindlers</h2>\n<p>Due to the presence of Prothean ruins on Kahje, the hanar have developed a religion centered on the ancient\nspecies, calling them the &quot;Enkindlers&quot;. The hanar practice a religious holiday called Nyahir or &quot;First Cresting Bloom&quot; which\nlasts a full thirteen days and revolves around celebrating the gift of speech, which they attribute to\nhaving come from the Enkindlers. It is a mixture of contemplation and competition, with the faithful engaged in stylized\ndebates, poetry duels, and other traditional hanar art forms. The winners of these events have their names inscribed in\nbio-luminescence on the side of Mount Vassla, an underwater volcano at the heart of one of the oldest Prothean ruins on Kahje.</p>\n<h2>The Compact</h2>\n<p>Several hundred years ago, the hanar made contact with the drell on their nearby homeworld of Rakhana. Drell society\nwas quickly collapsing due to overpopulation and warring over scarce resources, so the hanar rescued several\nhundred thousand drell and brought them to Kahje, where they integrated into hanar society with the remaining\ndrell dying out. Now the drell serve as a client race of the hanar, and although to outside observers the\nrelationship can be construed as a form of slavery, the reality is very different. Drell have integrated with every\nlevel of hanar society, and most consider it an honor to serve a hanar family in a tradition referred to as the Compact.\nMany drell become unofficial members of the family, and some even earn the privilege to learn their masters' &quot;soul names&quot;.</p>\n<h2>Language of Lights</h2>\n<p>The hanar communicate using sophisticated patterns of bioluminescence and speak with scrupulous precision and extreme politeness.\nOther species need machine assistance to translate, though many drell apply genetic modification to their eyes in order\nto perceive higher frequency flashes which allows them to understand the hanar. Most hanar take offense at improper\nlanguage and must take special courses to unlearn this tendency if they expect to deal with other species.</p>\n<h2>Hanar Names</h2>\n<p>The hanar have two names, a &quot;face name&quot; and a &quot;soul name.&quot; The face name is used as a general label for use by\nstrangers and acquaintances. The soul name is kept for use among close friends and relations and tends to be poetic.</p>\n<p><strong>Face Names</strong>: Anrynder, Delanynder, Ellanpo, Hymydwhyn, Lopyldis, Malvyll, Opold, Sedlyner, Tolystoyl, Wynold, Zymandis</p>\n<p><strong>Soul Names</strong>: Burns Brightest when the Foam Blooms, Casts Shadow on the Sun Flower, Emancipates the Tide from those that Pull,\nHeeds only to the Inner Lights, Illuminates the Folly of the Dancers, Regards the Works of the Enkindlers in Despair,\nTransforms the Stone into Water</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"Hanar\" source=\"wiki\"></source-reference></p>\n"

The krogan managed to not only survive on their\nunforgiving homeworld but actually thrived in the extreme conditions. Unfortunately, as krogan society became more\ntechnologically advanced, so did their weaponry. The end result is that they destroyed their homeworld in a nuclear war\nthat reduced their race into primitive warring tribes.</p>\n<h2>Biologically Impervious</h2>\n<p>Krogan biology reflects the conditions from where they come. The krogan are armored nearly head to toe in thick, chitinous\nplates which protect the krogan from the hazards of their homeland. They possess a hump which can store water and nutrients,\nfor the resources in Tuchanka are scare.</p>\n<p>Curiously, the krogan also possess redundant organs; a second set of major organs in case of failure or injury. These\ntraits make krogan exceptionally difficult to kill, but perhaps what makes krogan so dangerous is an adaptation known as &quot;Blood Rage.&quot;</p>\n<h2>Blood Rage</h2>\n<p>The blood rage is a legendary state of pure violence. When krogan enter a blood rage, they become nearly mindless\nkilling machines, fighting through all injury and even death. Blood rage is due to an enormous flood of adrenaline and\nsuppression of serotonin, which numbs the krogan to all pain. This state, combined with their plated hide, and redundant\norgans, allows the krogan to defeat creatures many times his size or power.</p>\n<h2>Climb Atop the Dead</h2>\n<p>Krogan's value one thing above all else: strength. Krogan society is built upon this hierarchy, where the strong rule\nand the weak perish. They live in clans lead by a Warlord, and those clans constantly war for resources and for power.\nEven within these clans, treachery and distrust run rampant. Krogan often fight for dominance within these clans and\nwill sacrifice their clan for personal gain without a second thought. Females are considered prizes and trophies and\nlive in clans separate from the males.</p>\n<h2>Rites and Rituals</h2>\n<p>The krogan culture is steeped in rituals. When a krogan is born, he suffers the Rite of Life. When wishes to join his\nfirst clan, he undergoes the Rite of Passage. If he wishes to be considered for breeding, he must take the Rite of Honor.\nWhen facing a new enemy, the Rite of Firsts is invoked.</p>\n<p>A Krogan clan also has a shaman, who has endured the Rite of Insight. The rituals endured by a shaman are lengthy and\ntorturous; most krogan who attempt the rite perish. Those who survive become the most respected member of their clan\nand are rarely challenged. The shaman is a clan's spiritual leader and guide and is believed to see into the spirit\nworld itself.</p>\n<h2>Krogan Names</h2>\n<p>Krogan names are fairly simple: a clan name followed by a given name, which is normally bestowed upon them by their father.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names</strong>: Archuk, Brood, Charr, Drax, Fortak, Grunt, Guld, Jarrod Nax, Okeer, Skarr, Strux, Uvenk, Wreav, Wrex</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names</strong>: Bakara, Chormi, Derge, Hazka, Jonde Kesh, Khorga, Kherake, Morda, Tegash, Vruxa, Zrogoga</p>\n<p><strong>Clan Names</strong>: Garbon, Gatatog, Jorgal, Khutarum, Nakmor, Srarkan, Traash, Urdnot, Verbok, Weryloc, Wudark</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"6-7\" source=\"races\" :additional=\"[{source: 'wiki', pages: 'Krogan'}]\"></source-reference></p>\n"

The Protheans arose from a\nsingle planet and developed an immense galaxy-wide empire encompassing many other spacefaring species. Not much is known\nabout them, but many of their artifacts, ruins and technology have apparently survived the ages.</p>\n<h2>Ancient Empire</h2>\n<p>After achieving spaceflight, the Protheans discovered the ruins of a previous spacefaring race, the inusannon, and from\nthose ruins learned about mass effect physics and developed FTL technology. The Protheans would expand throughout the\ngalaxy with the help of the mass relay network and make the Citadel their capital.</p>\n<p>Early in their development, the Protheans encountered a hostile machine intelligence which threatened to overwhelm them.\nTo defeat the machines, the Protheans decided to unite all of the galaxy's sentient organic life under their empire.\nThe other organic races were free to resist, but those that tried were crushed, and none ever managed to best the Protheans' might.</p>\n<h2>Reaper Invasion</h2>\n<p>The Protheans' belief that they could hold their own against machine intelligence was shattered with the arrival of the\nReapers in approximately 48,000 BCE, who were far more advanced than the machines the Protheans had been battling. They\nwere caught completely off-guard by the scale and rapidity of the assault. The Reapers entered the galaxy through the\nCitadel, instantly decapitating the Protheans' government and disrupting the mass relay network, isolating Prothean systems\nfrom one another. The Protheans' greatest strength, their unified empire, proved to be their downfall.</p>\n<h2>Stasis</h2>\n<p>In a desperate attempt to survive the Reaper invasion, the Protheans built massive, hidden stasis facilities that could\nhold hundreds of thousands of stasis pods. Some facilities were found by Reaper agents or betrayed by indoctrinated Protheans.\nUnfortunately, the facilities that remained hidden faced another challenge: a finite power source. The VI's left to control\nthese facilities began systematically cutting power to non-essential staff to conserve energy. 50,000 years later,\nthe number of active pods in each facility might be less than a dozen and without knowing the location of these hidden\nbunkers, its impossible to know how many protheans have survived.</p>\n<h2>All Eyes on You</h2>\n<p>As a prothean, you constantly attract the attention of other races. Your accent, mannerisms, figures of\nspeech, and appearance all mark you as more alien than most aliens. Curious glances are directed your\nway wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued\nby your ancient culture, to say nothing of everyday beings who are eager to hear stories of your origin.</p>\n<h2>Avatars</h2>\n<p>Protheans that ascended to places of prominence in their society were designated as avatars, or exemplars, of a particular\nvirtue of their culture. Example virtues include benevolence, cleanliness, courage, dignity, frugality, honor, justice,\nmercy, order, perseverance, temperance, tranquility, truthfulness, vengeance. As one of the last remaining Protheans,\nit is likely you are an avatar or, waking up to find you race all but extinct, you may self-appoint\nyour own virtue.</p>\n<h2>Prothean Names</h2>\n<p>Interestingly, protheans name themselves, usually after an icon or mentor.

    "html": "<p>Forced out of their homeland by sapient constructs of their own creation, quarian are exiled nomads that now sail the\nseas in search of a new homeland.</p>\n<h2>Exotic Fashion</h2>\n<p>Identifying a quarian is easy. All quarians wear enviro-suits, which are multipurpose outfits that protect them from\nforeign pathogens and diseases as well as acting as spacesuits for scavenging or repair of shuttles. Rannoch's ecosystem\nfeatured symbiotic microorganisms that aren't found anywhere else in the galaxy. Thus, when the quarians were exiled, they\nwere also burdened to life in a suit.</p>\n<p>The enviro-suits have moved beyond function, however, and into their culture. A quarian is rarely, if ever, seen\nwithout their suit and helmet, and when they return from their pilgrimage as adults, they are expected to modify their\nsuit to fit their personal reflection of their status as a productive member of the Flotilla.</p>\n<h2>Exiles of their Own Creations</h2>\n<p>Quarians have a long and deep history with creating constructs known as &quot;Geth,&quot; meaning &quot;Servant of the People&quot;. These\nconstructs were built to serve and protect the quarians, and most quarian families had at least one servant, while the\nquarian military consisted of these autonomous beings.</p>\n<p>The quarians sought to constantly improve their creation with more advanced virtual intelligence so they could complete increasingly\ncomplex tasks. These improvements lead to the geth's sapience and they began to question their masters. The quarians\nattempted to exterminate them, but after forming so much dependence on the geth, the quarians were swiftly defeated.\nWith many exterminated, the remaining quarians fled their homeland of Rannoch.</p>\n<h2>Cybernetic Improvements</h2>\n<p>Though the quarians have abandoned their long history of construct and VI creation, they put their knowledge of engineering\nand technology into their own bodies to augment themselves. These augments are crafted by artisans who have descended\nfrom or studied under those who originally worked with or programmed the geth. The implants themselves are normally\nsmall, no larger than the size of a palm, and when properly inserted give the quarian enhanced ability compared to\nthose without. A quarian chooses an augment before they leave for the Pilgrimage, and the implantation of the device\nis part of their sending off ceremony.</p>\n<h2>Migrant Fleet</h2>\n<p>The nomads travel together in a collective of ships known as the Flotilla or the Migrant Fleet and consists of those\nwho escaped death by the geth. The Flotilla contains over fifty thousand vessels collectively that travel the galaxy\nstrip-mining and harvesting resource to keep the fleet afloat. Some ships decide to depart the fleet to pursue their\nown goals but normally return to the fleet.</p>\n<p>When young quarian rejoin the flotilla after their pilgrimage, they are expected to join the crew of another vessel\nto ensure genetic diversity of an already small population.</p>\n<h2>The Pilgrimage</h2>\n<p>During quarian adolescence, they are subjected to a rite of passage known as the pilgrimage. When young adulthood is\nreached, quarians are expected to leave the Migrant Fleet and experience life outside of their culture. To rejoin the\nflotilla, the young quarian must bear a gift to the captain of a new vessel. This gift can be tangible, such as\nresources, or intangible such as information. Most quarian operatives are those on their pilgrimage, though there are\nthose who decide never to return to the fleet or those who were rejected from rejoining.</p>\n<h2>Quarian Names</h2>\n<p>Quarian names are composed of three parts: the quarian's given name and family name separated by an apostrophe, and the\nname of their vessel preceeded by a title - &quot;nar&quot; to denote their birth ship and &quot;vas&quot; to denote their post-pilgrimage ship.\nFor example, nar Rayya or vas Neema.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names</strong>: Golo, Han, Hilo, Kal, Kar, Keenah, Kenn, Lemm, Les, Prazza, Rael, Seeto, Shio, Veetor, Ysin, Zaal, Zer</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names</strong>: Ceni, Daro, Elan, Feda, Jura, Laele, Lia, Meeri, Minn, Reen, Saesa, Shala, Shuni, Tali, Yosi, Zohe,</p>\n<p><strong>Family Names</strong>: Breizah, Dannah, Gazu, Gerral, Hodda, Jaa, Koris, Leth, Mal, Mekk, Nara, Raan, Reegar, Shaal, Shiya, Vael, Xen, Zorah</p>\n<p><strong>Vessel Names</strong>: Honorata, Idenna, Moreh, Neema, Novarra, Qwib Qwib, Rayya, Tesleya, Tonbay, Ulnay, Usela</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"8-9\" source=\"races\" :additional=\"[{source: 'wiki', pages: 'Quarian'}]\"></source-reference></p>\n"

    "html": "<p>Salarians are a warm-blooded amphibious species from a jungle known as Sur'Kesh. The salarian possess a\nsuper-charged metabolism which causes them to function at a much higher speed than other races while requiring less rest.\nAdditionally, they have an exceptional capability for observation, recollection, and innovation. They are constantly\ntinkering, experimenting, inventing, and researching and value intelligence and knowledge above all else.</p>\n<h2>Hyperactive Metabolism</h2>\n<p>The speed at which a salarian metabolizes is a marvel of evolution. The race only requires only one hour of sleep a\nnight, and still, they have more energy and alertness than other races. Everything a salarian does seems to be faster.\nThey talk fast, think fast, move fast, eat fast, and even sleep fast. The large amount of available energy has\nadvanced their intellectual capabilities. They need near constant stimulation for their fidgety, active bodies.</p>\n<h2>Boredom, the Mother of Invention</h2>\n<p>Salarians minds are constantly racing at miles per minute, and without proper mental stimulation, a salarian becomes bored.\nTinkering and experimenting are natural solutions to a restless mind. The ability to plow through ideas, situations,\nand possibilities makes them natural inventors. Salarians have perhaps some of the most advanced technology, especially\nin electronics and engineering, but a salarian can become an expert at whatever craft he puts his mind to.</p>\n<h2>Knowledge is Power</h2>\n<p>Invention is not the only outlet of a salarian's mind. As many as those who invent prefer to gather information and\nknowledge. Observation, research, study, and espionage are other areas at which salarians tend to excel. A\nphotographic memory with a high capacity for information makes salarians who dabble in information trading very\nskilled and valuable. Knowledge gained from a salarian is highly prized as nearly infallible, and so these\ntrades are viable life paths.</p>\n<h2>One Mother Among Sons</h2>\n<p>Salarian reproduction is curious in that fertilized eggs hatch as females and unfertilized eggs hatch as male. According\nto ancient societal codes and law, fertilization of eggs is strictly regulated and thus 90% of the population is male.\nRomantic and sexual relationships are nearly nonexistent among salarian, and any sexuality is strictly for reproduction.\nAs females are so rare, they normally stay within salarian colonies where they possess positions of political\npower in a complex matriarchal government.</p>\n<h2>Matriarchal Feudalism</h2>\n<p>Salarians have a layered system of government, ultimately ruled by a matriarch known as a dalatrass, with her\ndaughters serving in noble positions beneath her. A noble family headed by the dalatrass controls a massive territory\nknown as a march that is further divided into duchies, baronies, and fiefdoms. Dalatrasses and their noble\nmatrilinear lines will make political alliances with other families through interbreeding. A salarian\nis loyal through a biological process known as imprinting to their parents and to their dalatrass, which keeps the feudal society stable.</p>\n<h2>Intense Curiosity</h2>\n<p>Despite imprinted loyalty to their family and dalatrass, male salarians are free to leave the colony at any time. Females,\nhowever, due to their noble blood and political power, almost always stay within the confines of salarian territories,\nthough some do venture out for other political positions such as ambassadors or emissaries. Salarian curiosity and\npursuit of knowledge often lead them past the jungles of Sur'Kesh, if even only for a brief time. Many find new\nlives far from Sur'Kesh, though they rarely truly abandon their family and dalatrass.</p>\n<h2>Salarian Names</h2>\n<p>Salarian names are quite complex. A full name includes - in order - the name of a salarian's march,\nduchy, barony, fiefdom, family, and finally, the given name. However, few salarians use their full name unless\nnecessary and prefer to go by their family and given name.</p>\n<p><strong>Example Full Names</strong>: Rannadril Ghan Swa Fulsoom Karaten Narr Eadi Bel Anoleis, Gorot II Heranon Mal Dinest Got Inoste Ledra</p>\n<p><strong>Given Names</strong>: Beelo, Chorban, Esheel, Ish, Jarroth, Jarun, Jondum, Kallo, Kirrahe, Maelon, Mordin, Morlan, Padok, Palon, Rentola, Schells, Solik, Tazzik, Tolan, Valern, Zevin</p>\n<p><strong>Family Names</strong>: Aenarth, Aulaw, Bau, Erkoln, Faergow, Gurji, Heplorn, Inoste, Irheth, Jath, Jowar, Marhall, Raeka, Sernik, Solus, Tann, Vass, Venirn, Vodol, Wiks, Yosann</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"10-11\" source=\"races\" :additional=\"[{source: 'wiki', pages: 'Salarian'}]\"></source-reference></p>\n"

    "html": "<p>A highly militaristic race, turians are a force to be feared. These warriors are easily distinguished by an appearance\ncontaining a strange mix of insectoid and avian features. The turian army is substantial, and every member of the turian\nrace is obligated to attend combat training in adolescence. Even citizens and artisans are foes to be reckoned with.\nDespite such an emphasis on combat, however, turians are an honorable and noble race.</p>\n<h2>Discipline and Honor</h2>\n<p>The entire turian culture revolves around a strict code of conduct which highly emphasizes strong discipline and personal\nresponsibility. Turians are highly inclined towards self-sacrifice and will put the good of society over their own\npersonal desires. As such, they are passionate about public and social service and make poor merchants and entrepreneurs.\nThey are taught to own their decisions, good or bad, and if confronted with accusations it is considered heinous to\nlie about their actions. Because of this, many races attribute to them a &quot;turian honor&quot; seen rarely outside the turian race.</p>\n<h2>Proud Warrior Race</h2>\n<p>At the center of turian society is their military. Turians are sent to basic training in their teenage years\nand are obligated to serve time in the military, if physically able. This develops respect for\nauthority as well as imparting control and restraint among the turians. Though some turians do not continue their\nservice in the armed forces, they continue to serve their community through other branches of the military which serve\nthe whole by providing public services.</p>\n<h2>Hierarchal Meritocracy</h2>\n<p>Turian government is entwined with its military, as so many parts of society are. There are tiers of citizenship, with\nthe lowest being a regular citizen, often held by client races and children, climbing all the way up to the Primarchs\nwhich lead each turian colony. Lower ranking citizens are expected to obey and support superiors while higher ranking\nones are expected to lead and protect lower ranks. Promotion to a new tier is based on personal ability and merit and\nare given due to assessments from one's superiors.</p>\n<p>Despite the ranked structure, turians entertain many freedoms as long as they perform their duties and do not infringe\non others freedoms or responsibilities.</p>\n<h2>Reflective Carapace</h2>\n<p>The homeland of the turians, Palaven, has a high level of solar radiation. Turians have evolved semi-metallic\ncarapaces that reflect the dangerous radiation, protecting their inners from the solar rays. These exoskeletons, however,\ndo not protect the turian from physical damage such as wounds and do not provide any natural armor.</p>\n<h2>Mission or Desertion</h2>\n<p>Most Turians who leave Palaven or another colony do so by order of their superiors to accomplish special missions.\nSome, however, abandon the society for various reasons, most commonly a desire for freedom from the unyielding law and command.\nThose who desert their military post or other assigned position are exiled from Palaven, as this is seen as the ultimate betrayal.</p>\n<h2>Turian Names</h2>\n<p>Turians are given personal names by their parents and take on a family name. High-ranking turian officers also include\ntheir title in their names, either in addition to their full names or as a replacement of their personal name.\nSometimes turians go by their family name only.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names</strong>: Adrien, Avitas, Castis, Chellick, Corinthus, Desolas, Garrus, Illo, Jacobus, Joram, Kuril, Lantar, Lilihierax, Lorik, Macen, Mehrkuri, Nihlus, Quentius, Sapartus, Saren, Septimus, Tarquin, Tiran, Tonn, Venari,</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names</strong>: Abrudas, Aciia, Aemicida, Alta, Banrae, Caevea, Cicean, Duronea, Iciria, Juteia, Nyreen, Orinia, Pliras, Quidas, Selone, Sidera, Sipia, Valevas, Vetra</p>\n<p><strong>Family Names</strong>: Actus, Arterius, Barro, Kandros, Kryik, Nazario, Nyx, Oraka, Pallin, Qui'in, Rix, Sidonis, Talid, Vakarian, Victus, Vyrnnus</p>\n<p><source-reference pages=\"12-13\" source=\"races\" :additional=\"[{source: 'wiki', pages: 'Turian'}]\"></source-reference></p>\n"

They\nhail from Irune, which possesses a high-pressure greenhouse atmosphere able to support ammonia-based biochemistry.</p>\n<h2>Mysterious Biology</h2>\n<p>The volus are unable to survive unprotected in an atmosphere more suitable to humans and other carbon-based lifeforms,\nand as such require pressurized, protective suits capable of providing the proper atmosphere. Traditional nitrogen/oxygen\nair mixtures are poisonous to them, and in the low pressure atmospheres tolerable to most species, their flesh will actually\nsplit open.Unlike quarians, who can withstand brief periods outside their suit, volus choose never to take theirs off,\nespecially in the presence of other races. Therefore, little is known about their physiology. Despite individuals distinctly\nsounding like males or females to human listeners, volus genders are a mystery as well. The volus themselves consider\nthe question both intrusive and hilariously irrelevant.</p>\n<h2>Trade Warriors</h2>\n<p>The volus homeworld Irune is remarkable for having done away with warfare as an institution of the state. Instead,\nvolus romanticize a good bargain, haggling, and creative accounting. The fervent pursuit of economic wealth has\nmade volus a race of aggressive traders and industrialists with a keen grasp of exchange and finance.\nMany of the galaxy's largest banks, holding corporations, and manufacturing cartels, such as the\nElkoss Combine, are owned or managed by volus. They also regulate the Citadel's complex galactic economy and were\nresponsible for the Unified Banking Act, which established the &quot;credit&quot; as the standard currency of interstellar\ntrade.</p>\n<p>Unlike most other races, volus are more comfortable with delayed gratification, especially when it comes to spending\ntheir credits. Fugacious and materialistic purchases are rarely made. Instead, volus like to invest or save their money,\nsometimes to a fault. In fact, the volus economy is largely bolstered by the large estates of wealthy volus who never\nspent a cred.</p>\n<h2>Council Seat</h2>\n<p>Despite their important contributions to the Citadel and galactic society, they have never been offered a seat on the\nCouncil. This is a source of anger for some volus, particularly the volus ambassador Din Korlack. Council races need\nto have provided some extraordinary service to the Citadel, such as the turians' military support during the\nKrogan Rebellions. Council races also need to provide fleets, resources, and economic aid in case of disaster,\nnone of which the volus can currently supply. Therefore, the latest investment pursued by the volus is the construction\nof well-armed dreadnoughts.</p>\n<h2>Volus Names</h2>\n<p>Volus have two names but no family names.

Even as their population grows, the vorcha constantly fight each other in fierce competition over basic\nnecessities. This incessant warfare has made each generation of vorcha stronger and more aggressive than that which\npreceded it, but their continual lack of resources has kept vorcha society extremely primitive.</p>\n<h2>Non-differentiated cells</h2>\n<p>The vorcha are known for a rather unique biology: they have clusters of non-differentiated cells, similar to those found\non the planarian worm of Earth. These cells allow the vorcha limited regenerative abilities, as well as the ability to\nadapt quickly to its environment, such as developing thicker skin after being burned or increased musculature to survive\nin high gravity. When a vorcha is injured or in distress, these cells move to the affected area and rapidly\n(~1 week) mature to specialized forms that will alleviate the issue.</p>\n<h2>Clan Violence</h2>\n<p>Vorcha society is built around combat. In fact, the vorcha use combat, both individually and in groups, as their\ndefault form of communication. The vorcha are a clan-based people who prefer living in communal environments with\nothers of their species to living alone or in the company of alien races. When a clan population grows too large,\nyounger members will depart to start a new clan elsewhere.
