Indoctrination is measured in six levels. For each 24 hour\nperiod a creature spends within the presence of an indoctrinating source, the creature must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw.\nOn a failed save, the creature suffers one level of indoctrination. If an already indoctrinated creature spends another\n24 hour period within the presence of Reaper technology, the DC of the saving throw increases as described below.\n\n\nLevel\nNext Wisdom DC\nEffect\n\n\n\n\n1\n12\nYou have difficulty sleeping and constantly have dreams of inky black and oily shadows. To gain the benefits of a long rest takes an additional 4 hours.\n\n\n2\n14\nYou begin showings signs of paranoia, having feelings of being watched. You have disadvantage on all your Charisma-based skill checks.\n\n\n3\n16\nYou have extreme paranoia. You have disadvantage on all of your Wisdom- and Intelligence-based skill checks.\n\n\n4\n18\nYou begin to hear voices that issue simple commands. If you do not immediately follow the command, you take 11 (2d10) psychic damage. This damage bypasses shields.\n\n\n5\n20\nThe voices in your head speak to you often and you begin to agree with what they're saying. You are considered charmed.\n\n\n6\n-\nYou become a Reaper thrall and lose all control of your character (You are effectively dead).\n\n\n\nReducing Indoctrination Levels\nEvery long rest that a creature spends outside of the range of an indoctrinating source, it can make a new\nWisdom saving throw (DC based on its current indoctrination level). On a success, reduce its indoctrination level by 1.\nNote: Synthetic creatures are immune to indoctrination.\nReaper Tech\nUsually, indoctrination happens when another creature (such as a reaper, thorian, or leviathan) is actively trying to\nindoctrinate one or many creatures. An exception to this is Reaper technology (i.e., reaper parts or devices salvaged from\nbattle or space). Reaper technology can passively indoctrinate creatures that are merely in the technology's presence.\nDetermining if a creature is within the presence of a piece of Reaper technology is based on the technology's size.\nThe larger the object, the farther the range.\nDistance of Indoctrination\n\n\nSize of tech\nRange\n\n\n\n\nTiny\n\n\n\nSmall\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n\nLarge\n\n\n\nHuge\n\n\n\nGargantuan\n\n\n\n",

It's also home to a variety of sentient alien species,\nall with their own culture, planets, and colonies, making up a vast galactic community. If you aren't familiar\nwith the first Mass Effect video games, you can read about major events and lore at the\nMass Effect Wiki. Specifically, the\ntimeline can get you quickly up to speed on the events\nof the galaxy.\nThe Andromeda Galaxy has a very different feeling. An ancient civilization of &quot;Remnant&quot; seem to exist on every planet, connected\nby seemingly supernatural threads. Only two known sentient species existed in the Galaxy before the arrival of the Milky Way\nspecies. Now the galaxy and its inhabitants are threatened by a widespread energy phenomenon called, The Scourge. The Milky Way\nspecies arrived on Arks and are working to settle habitable planets around the galaxy and start a new life. If you'd like\nto read more about the events of Mass Effect: Andromeda, the wiki\nhas plenty of information.\nBoth galaxies share the same characteristics that are nascent to Mass Effect, i.e. biotics, tech, and space travel, but\neach galaxy offers its own zeitgeist and challenges. The Milky Way is mostly explored and contains extensive urban environments.\nYou could easily set an entire campaign on a single planet and, depending on when you set your campaign, you might also deal with the impending invasion of the Reapers.\nIn contrast, Andromeda is themed for exploration, survival, and being a pioneer. An operatives' primary goal is that of\nsetting up a thriving civilization in the new galaxy and uncovering its mysterious past. In short, the Milky Way\nis an urban setting with a defined lore and timeline. Andromeda is rural and sandbox setting for campaigns.\nYour GM might set the campaign in one of these galaxies or on a single planet that he or she created. Because there is so\nmuch diversity among the galaxies in Mass Effect and so much unwritten lore, you should check with your GM about any house\nrules that will affect your play of the game. Ultimately, the Galaxy Master is the authority on the campaign and its setting,\neven if the setting is a published world.\nIt is unlikely that your GM will have the campaign span between the two galaxies.

    "body": "An ability check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The\nGM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance\nof failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.\nFor every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of\nthe task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes\ntable shows the most common DCs.\nTypical Difficulty Classes\n\n\nTask Difficulty\nDC\n\n\n\n\nVery Easy\n5\n\n\nEasy\n10\n\n\nMedium\n15\n\n\nHard\n20\n\n\nVery Hard\n25\n\n\nNearly Impossible\n30\n\n\nTo make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and\npenalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success -\nthe creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the character or monster makes\nno progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.\nContests\nSometimes one character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed to another's. This can occur when both of them are\ntrying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a grenade that has fallen on the floor.\nThis situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal - for example,\nwhen a brute tries to force open a door that an operative is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is\ndetermined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.\nBoth participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and\npenalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with\nthe higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other\none from succeeding.\nIf the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might\nwin the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a grenade the floor, neither character grabs it.\nIn a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an operative trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that\nthe door remains shut.\nSkills change\nMass Effect 5e is a sci-fi setting, thus some of the fantasy skills (like religion and arcana) have been replaced with new\nskills.\nRemoved Skills: Animal Handling, Arcana, Nature, Religion\n\nNew Skills: Electronics, Engineering, Science, Vehicle Handling\nEach ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in.\nA skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual's proficiency in a skill demonstrates a\nfocus on that aspect. A character's starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster's\nskill proficiencies appear in the monster's stat block.\nFor example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character's attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or\nto stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth,\nrespectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related\nto sneaking and hiding.\nThe skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. No skills are related to Constitution. See an\nability's description in the Appendix: Skills for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.\nStrength\n\nAthletics\n\nDexterity\n\nAcrobatics\nSleight of Hand\nStealth\nVehicle Handling\n\nIntelligence\n\nElectronics\nEngineering\nHistory\nInvestigation\nScience\n\nWisdom\n\nInsight\nMedicine\nPerception\nSurvival\n\nCharisma\n\nDeception\nIntimidation\nPerformance\nPersuasion\n\n\nSometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill - for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.”\nAt other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case,\nproficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that\nskill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.\nFor example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If\nthe character is proficient in Athletics, the character's proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character\nlacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.\nVariant: Paragon &amp; Renegade new\nIn Mass Effect 5e, you may also choose to use the Variant: Paragon &amp; Renegade.\nThis new rule allows you to apply another bonus to your ability checks, pending the context of your action is &quot;Paragon-ish&quot;\nor &quot;Renegade-ish&quot;.\nPassive Checks\nA passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the\naverage result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for laser tripwires over and over again, or can be used when\nthe GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a\nhidden sniper.\nHere's how to determine a character's total for a passive check:\n10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check\nIf the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check\ntotal as a score.\nFor example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom\n(Perception) score of 14. The rules on hiding in the Dexterity section below rely on passive checks, as do\nthe exploration rules.\nWorking together\nSometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who's leading the effort - or the one with the\nhighest ability modifier - can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters.\nIn combat, this requires the Help action.\nA character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to hack a\nsecurity system requires proficiency with hacking tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can't help another\ncharacter in that task.\nMoreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some\ntasks, such as reloading a thermal clip, are no easier with help.\nGroup Checks\nWhen a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check.\nIn such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't.\nTo make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds,\nthe whole group succeeds.\nOtherwise, the group fails. Group checks don't come up very often, and they're most useful when all the characters\nsucceed or fail as a group. For example, when operatives are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group\nWisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the\nenvironment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of\ndanger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.\n\n",

Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.\nWhen you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and\nwhat kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.\nAttack\nThe most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing a gun, or brawling\nwith your fists.\nWith this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the Making an Attack section for the rules that govern attacks.\nCertain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the soldier, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.\nCast a Power\nPowercasters such as engineers and adepts have access to biotics or tech powers and can use them to great effect in combat.\nEach power has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours\nto cast the power. Casting a power is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most powers do have a casting time of 1 action,\nso a powercaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a power.\nDash\nWhen you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after\napplying any modifiers. With a speed of , for example, you can move up to  on your turn if you dash.\nAny increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of \nis reduced to , for instance, you can move up to  this turn if you dash.\nDisengage change\nIf you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn. In  Mass Effect 5e,\nthe Disengage action can also kick off your shield regeneration, detailed later.\nDodge change\nWhen you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack\nroll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage.\nYou lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or if your speed drops to 0.\nThe Dodge action can also jumpstart shield regeneration.\nHelp\nYou can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you\naid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes\nthe check before the start of your next turn.\nAlternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within  of you. You feint, distract the\ntarget, or in some other way team up to make your ally's attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before\nyour next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.\nHide change\nWhen you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for\nhiding.\nIf you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the &quot;Unseen Attackers and Targets&quot; section later.\nHiding is the third possible way to jumpstart your shield regeneration.\nReady\nSometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take\nthe Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.\nFirst, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in\nresponse to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include &quot;If the Blue Suns grunt steps\non the conveyor belt, I'll push the button that starts it,&quot; and &quot;If the rachni steps next to me, I move away.&quot;\nWhen the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember\nthat you can take only one reaction per round.\nWhen you ready a power, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger\noccurs. To be readied, a power must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the power's magic requires\nconcentration. If your concentration is broken, the power dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are\nconcentrating on the singularity power and ready lance, your singularity power end, and if you take damage before you\nrelease lance with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.\nReload new\nAll guns have a heat property which indicates the number of times it can be fired before the thermal clip must be exchanged.\nWhen you take the Reload Action, you expend a Thermal Clip from your inventory and insert it into the weapon you're currently\nholding, returning the weapon's heat to its maximum value.\nVariant: Rapid Reload\nAt the start of your turn, if you are holding only a single weapon, you may use a Bonus Action to attempt a Rapid Reload.\nMake a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. On a success, you reload the weapon you're currently holding and may continue your turn as normal.\nOn a failure, you must take the Reload action this turn. On a critical failure, the thermal clip drops from your hand,\nyour weapon is not reloaded, and you lose your Action.\nWhy is this a variant rule? Although there are class features and weapon mods that allow you to reload as a bonus action,\nthis variant rule gives all classes a potential chance to reload as a bonus action. In turn, this increases the number of\npotential rolls per combat, which can be cumbersome and distracting. It's up to the GM and players to decide if this rule\nis right for their group.\nSearch\nWhen you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search,\nthe GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.\nUse an Object\nYou normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw your weapon as part of an attack.\nWhen an object requires your action for its use (such as throwing a grenade), you take the Use an Object action.\nThis action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.\n\n",

    "body": "To survive in the galaxy, your character needs to wear armor. Not only does armor abate damage from extremely powerful,\nfuturistic weapons but armor also supplies shield points, also called shields (outlined below). Luckily, almost all\ngarments in the mass effect world provide some form of protection. Diaphanous night-gowns can even provide a modicum of\nprotection. Thus, in Mass Effect 5e, almost all operatives are wearing armor and are afforded shield points, unless the player\nor GM explicitly states your character is not wearing armor.\nArmor Proficiency. Just like 5th edition, anyone can put on armor. However, only those proficient in the armor type\nknow how to wear it effectively. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor (light, medium, or heavy).\nIf you are wearing 2 or more pieces of armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check,\nsaving throw, or Attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity. If you are wearing 4 pieces of armor you lack\nproficiency with, you cannot cast powers.\nArmor Class (AC). Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor you wear determines your base Armor Class.\nShield Points. new All armor chest pieces\nprovide some amount of shield points. See the Shields section of the combat section for\nmore information.\nMix &amp; Match new\nUnlike D&amp;D 5th edition, armor in Mass Effect 5e can be mixed between armor placements on the body. There are 4 armor placements:\nHead, Chest, Arms, and Legs.\nYour base AC is 10 and each piece of armor provides an AC bonus depending on its type and placement as listed in\nthe Armor / AC table. Additionally, there are bonuses and limitations for the combination of armor types you are wearing,\nexplained in the Armor Bonuses and Limitations table.\nHeavier Armor. Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the\nArmor Bonuses and Limitations table shows “Str 12” or “Str 16” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor\nreduces the wearer’s speed by  unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.\nFor simplicity's sake, you cannot mix armor within placements. I.e., you cannot have a heavy piece of on your right arm\nand a light piece of armor on your left.\nArmor/AC\n\n\nPlacement/Type\nLight\nMedium\nHeavy\n\n\n\n\nChest\n+1\n+2\n+3\n\n\nArms\n+0\n+1\n+2\n\n\nLegs\n+0\n+1\n+2\n\n\nHead\nUnless otherwise listed, headware provides no bonus to AC.\n\n\nArmor Bonuses and Limitations\n\n\nIf you are wearing...\nDexterity Bonus to AC\nStrength\nStealth\n\n\n\n\n3+ pieces of Heavy armor\n-\nStr 16\nDisadvantage\n\n\n2 pieces of Heavy armor\n-\nStr 15\nDisadvantage\n\n\n1 piece of Heavy armor\n-\nStr 13\nDisadvantage\n\n\n3+ pieces of Medium armor\nMax +2\nStr 13\nDisadvantage\n\n\n2 pieces of Medium armor\nMax +2\nStr 12\n-\n\n\n1 piece of Medium armor\nMax +2\n-\n-\n\n\nLight or no armor\n+ Dex modifier\n-\n-\n\n\nBody Armor is considered three pieces (arms, chest, and legs)\n\n\nVariant: Encumbrance\nIf you are using the Variant: Encumbrance rules,\nuse the Armor Piece Weights table to determine the total weight of the armor you're wearing.\n\n\nPlacement/Type\nLight\nMedium\nHeavy\n\n\n\n\nChest\n3kg\n6kg\n10kg\n\n\nArms\n1kg\n2kg\n3kg\n\n\nLegs\n1kg\n2kg\n3kg\n\n\nHead\nAll headware weighs 2kg\n\n\nArmor Sets new\nMost armor you buy in the galaxy has been mass-produced, these are called armor sets. A set is not required to be\nmultiple pieces of armor. For example, the Capacitor Helmet is a single piece of head armor. The unique aspect of armor\nsets is that they have benefits and attributes that are pre-installed due to their mass-production. Thus, you cannot\ncustomize armor sets with armor mods and you cannot salvage a beneficial aspect from an armor set.\nArmor sets have an armor type (light, medium, or heavy) which you use for calculating your character's AC.\nBody Armor is a special type of armor piece that consists of 3 pieces of armor: Chest, Arms, and Legs. Body\narmor is completely integrated (all or none), therefore, you cannot swap out pieces from other sets. I.e., if you're\nwearing the Duelist body armor, you cannot replace the legs from it with the Lockdown Greaves. This rule is, of course, flexible,\nas GMs might allow this type of tinkering in exchange for time, credits, and/or skill checks.\nSet Bonuses are additional benefits you receive from wearing multiple pieces from the same set, signifying the armors\ncomponent pieces working together for a unified integration. Armor with the same base name is part of a set, e.g. Colossus [item].\nYou only receive the benefit once per set and the benefit ends immediately if you fall below the threshold. For example,\nif a set provides:\nMedium Armor\n\nSet Bonus (2 of 4): +1 AC\nSet Bonus (4 of 4): +1 AC\n\nIf you are wearing the head and chest pieces, you gain +0 AC from the helmet and +2 AC from the chest piece (as calculated\nusing the Armor / AC table). In addition you gain +1 AC from wearing 2 pieces of the set. Note, you do not gain +1 AC\nfor the head and +1 AC for the chest. As soon as you remove either the helmet or the chest\napiece, you loose the +1 AC bonus.\nEnvironmental Protection new\nAll armor provides basic environmental protection from the vacuum of space or hazardous atmospheres. Armor supplies enough\nair and heat to the wearer for 8 hours of activity or 16 hours if the operative remains motionless. Your GM may require\nthat your character wear a helmet to gain this benefit, or they may use the bubble rule and claim that all armor suits\ncan cast an energy &quot;bubble&quot; around your characters head to keep air in and the environment out.\nGetting Into and Out of Armor\nThe time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor's category.\nDon. This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor's AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.\nDoff. This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half.\n\n\nCategory\nDon\nDoff\n\n\n\n\nLight Armor\n1 minute\n1 minute\n\n\nMedium Armor\n5 minutes\n1 minute\n\n\nHeavy Armor\n10 minutes\n5 minutes\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "All vehicles share some of the same basic features.\nArmor Class\nAC for vehicles works exactly the same as in the basic 5e rules.\nHull Points (hit points)\nThis represents how much damage a vehicle or starship can take before it is destroyed.\nShield Points\nShields for vehicles and starships work generally the same as in the main ME5e rules,\nwith a notable exception: Vehicle shields can only be regenerated in combat when players attempt the\nRestore action (explained later in this section).\nSpeed\nFor vehicles, speed is relative to other vehicles and is represented as a static number not as . For\nthe purposes of combat, it represents the number of playmat spaces the vehicle can move on its turn when moving\nat a normal pace.\nRange\nRange represents how far the vehicle can travel in one 24 period. For starships, range is represented in &quot;Faster-than-light-units&quot;\nor FTLUs and is used in conjunction with\nthe Galaxy Map. Each line indicates the travel time between star systems, which you subtract from the starships range.\nTravel to planets within a star systems costs 1 range. You can read more about range for starships in the\nTraveling the Galaxy section\nMinimum Crew\nThe number of crew required for the vehicle to operate. In some cases, at the GM’s discretion, it may be possible to\noperate a vehicle with less than the minimum required number of crew. Rolls made to operate vehicles in these conditions\nwill most likely be made at disadvantage, again at the GM’s discretion.\nCrew Capacity\nThe total number of sentient organisms that a ship can accommodate. This is a combination of active crew and any passengers.\nIn some cases, this number can be expanded by using cargo capacity, below.\nCargo Capacity\nHow much “stuff” a vehicle can hold. This is measured in Megagrams (also known as a “tonne” or “metric ton”).\n1 Mg = 1,000 kg = 2,204 lbs.\nThis will be rounded to the nearest 0.5 mg (500 kg). When calculating cargo\ncapacity, we suggest using this as a guideline to estimate cargo capacity rather than getting bogged down in specific\ncalculations. For points of reference, a small hatchback car weighs just over 1 Mg while the largest tanker ships\nin the world have a capacity of over 200,000 Mg.\nSystems\nSystems refer to a number of semi-independent functions that make-up the overall operation of a vehicle. These are\nthings like navigation, communications, weapons array, etc. These are used to simulate the cooperative effort involved\nin operating larger, complex vessels, and player characters will often be called upon to make skill-based rolls to\noperate these individual systems. Generally speaking, small vehicles, especially those with only a single crew member,\nwill not have designated systems.\nWeapons\nWeapons, in many cases, will refer to a specific system or systems on a vehicle. Vehicle-mounted weapons will\ntypically have a multiplier after their damage roll to represent how powerful they are. For example, a cruiser’s mass\naccelerator cannon has a damage roll of 2d6[x100] and an M35 Mako’s coaxial machine-gun has a damage roll of 2d6[x10].\nIn these situations, you roll and add damage dice and any bonuses as usual. After you have determined your result,\nmultiply the total by the amount indicated. In our example, if both weapons roll a 7 for their damage, the cruiser\ndeals 700 damage and the Mako deals 70.\nSize\nMost transports use the standard size categories: Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. However,\nstarships can become truly colossal and have 4 additional categories.\nFrigates are light transport vehicles, usually used for exploration, transportation of small squads, privately\nfunded excursions, or stealth transport. The Normandy is an example of a frigate. Frigates can land on planets and\ntypically host a crew of 5-20.\nCruisers are middleweight ships that can either transport large amounts of supplies from place to place or focus on\nfirepower. Military cruisers tend to be the front-line of the battle and have powerful weapons, shields, and armor.\nCruisers typically have crews of 20 - 100 and are able to land on planets.\nCarriers, also called freighters,\nare large ships meant to carry transports (starfighters and dropships). Carriers are primarily military\nin nature though some venture capitalists have used carriers for mining operations and colonizing efforts. Carriers are\ntypically weak in combat, being slow and lacking much firepower or shielding. Instead, carriers utilize their transports\nfor offense and defense. Carriers are built in space and are too large to land on planets (purposefully). Instead, most\ncarriers use drop ships for planetary exploration. Carriers can support crews in the hundreds.\nDreadnoughts are the largest class of ship, generally a kilometer or more long with incredible firepower that’s\nharnessed in the main cannon which is able to decimate entire cities, squads of enemy fighters, and other dreadnoughts. Dreadnoughts\nare meant for extended life in space, usually hosting a crew in the thousands and a self-sustaining ecosystem of shops,\nleisure activities, police force, politics, etc. Think of dreadnaughts as a small town floating through space. The arks\nof Andromeda were dreadnoughts as are the Liveships that the quarian species inhabits. The ships are so costly to make\nthat the total number of dreadnoughts in the Milky Way is less than 200 with most species having only one or none. It’s\nimpossible to land Dreadnoughts on planets safely.\nCost\nThe costs listed for vehicles represent their market value. Some vehicles, instead, are military meaning the vehicles\ncannot be purchased on the open market. Instead, characters will need inside connects, the black market, or luck\nto acquire these vehicles.\nCR\nTransports have a CR between 0 and 30, which is based on its hp, ac, and damage. Starships have a + symbol after\ntheir CR, which indicates that this CR is a relative representation based on other starships. It is unlikely that operatives\nwill destroy a starship with traditional weapons. Instead, they'll likely have to use other vehicles. For example,\na starship with a CR of 12+ has the same XP reward as a level CR creature when the operatives destroy it\nusing other vehicles. If operatives did manage to destroy the vehicle using traditional means, we recommend\nproviding XP equal to the standard amount multiplied by 10. For example, a cr 12 creature provides 8,400 XP. If players\ndestroyed this with traditional means, the GM can reward 84,000 XP.\n",

    "body": "Between trips to remote planets and battles against reaper forces, operatives need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare\nfor their next mission. Many operatives also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting or modding arms and\narmor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned credits.\nIn some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new mission,\nthe GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your\ncharacter has been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond\nyour perception stay in motion.\nLifestyle Expenses\nBetween missions, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle.\nLiving a particular lifestyle doesn't have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other\nindividuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to\ninfluence the officials of the city than if you live in poverty.\nSee: Rules &gt; Finances &gt; Lifestyle Expenses\nDowntime Activities\nBetween missions, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can\nvary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit,\nand at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be\nconsecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer\nperiod of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.\nDowntime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her\ndowntime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.\nCrafting\nYou can craft weapons, mods, armor, other equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the\nobject you are trying to create (typically artisan's tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations\nnecessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with armorsmith's tools needs a source of power and intense heat\nin order to craft armor or install mods.\nFor every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 500 credits,\nand you must expend raw materials or omni-gel worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market\nvalue greater than 500 credits, you make progress every day in 500-credit increments until you reach the market value of\nthe item. For example, Blood Dragon Armor (market value 101,300 credits) takes 203 days to craft by yourself.\nMultiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all\nhave proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 1000 credits\nworth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool\nproficiency and the proper facilities can craft the Blood Dragon Armor in 68 days, at a total cost of 50,650 credits.\nWhile crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 150 credits per day, or a comfortable\nlifestyle at half the normal cost.\nPracticing a Profession\nYou can work between missions, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 150 credits per day.\nThis benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession. If you are a member of an organization that can provide\ngainful employment you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.\nIf you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn\nenough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.\nRecuperating\nYou can use downtime between missions to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.\nAfter three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save,\nyou can choose one of the following results:\n\nEnd one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.\nFor the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.\n\nResearching\nThe time between missions is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over\nthe course of the campaign. Research can include poring over the exonet, buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and\ngossip from their lips, or paying for information from certain factions like the Shadow Broker Network.\nWhen you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will\ntake to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual,\nfile, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation)\ncheck to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone's aid,\nor an Intelligence (Electronics) check to hack into a database. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information\nif it is available.\nFor each day of research, you must spend 100 credits to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your\nnormal lifestyle expenses.\nTraining\nYou can spend time between missions training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training options.\nFirst, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more\nability checks are required.\nThe training lasts for 250 days and costs 100 credits per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money,\nyou gain proficiency with the new tool.\n\n",

    "body": "When a character casts any power, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character's class, the type of power,\nor the power's effects.\nEach power description begins with a block of information, including the power's name, casting time, range, and duration.\nLevel and load are provided for biotic and tech powers, respectively.\nThe rest of a power entry describes the power's effect.\nCasting Time\nMost powers require a single action to cast, but some powers require a bonus action, a reaction, or even longer to cast.\nCombat powers can require an Attack action to cast.\nBonus Action\nA power cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the power,\nprovided that you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.\nReactions\nSome powers can be cast as reactions. These powers take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response\nto some event. If a power can be cast as a reaction, the power description tells you exactly when you can do so.\nAttack action\nMany Combat powers have an action cost of Attack. This means you must use the Attack combat action to cast the power. If\na power or effect prevents you from taking the Attack action, you cannot cast the power.\nLonger Casting Times\nCertain powers require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a power with a casting time longer than\na single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the power, and you must maintain your\nconcentration while you do so. If your concentration is broken, the power fails, but you don't expend a power slot or\nspend tech points. If you want to try casting the power again, you must start over.\nRange\nThe target of a power must be within the power's range. For a power like lance, the target is a creature. For a power\nlike havoc strike, the target is the point in space where your character lands emitting a violent shockwave.\nMost powers have ranges expressed in . Some powers can target only a creature (including you) that you touch.\nOther powers, such as the fortification power, affect only you. These powers have a range of self.\nPowers that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin\npoint of the power's effect must be you.\nOnce a power is cast, its effects aren't limited by its range, unless the power's description says otherwise.\nComponents change\nIn Mass Effect 5e, all powers are Somatic, meaning they require some amount of gesturing. To cast any of the power types\na caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.\nThere are no other power components (such as verbal or material, as in D&amp;D).\nDuration\nA power's duration is the length of time the power persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or\neven years. Some powers specify that their effects last until the powers are dipowered or destroyed.\nInstantaneous\nMany powers are instantaneous. The power harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can't\nbe dipowered, because its effect exists only for an instant.\nConcentration\nSome powers require you to maintain concentration in order to keep the effect going. This is the case with many biotics.\nIf you lose concentration, such a power ends.\nIf a power must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the power specifies how long\nyou can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).\nNormal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:\n\nCasting another power that requires concentration. You lose concentration on a power if you cast another power that\nrequires concentration. You can't concentrate on two powers at once.\nTaking damage. Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a power, you must make a Constitution saving\nthrow to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take\ndamage from multiple sources, such as a bullet and an engineer's salvo, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.\nBeing incapacitated or killed. You lose concentration on a power if you are incapacitated or if you die.\nThe GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as getting sucked out of an airlock, require you\nto succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a power.\n\nTargets\nA typical power requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the power's magic. A power's description\ntells you whether the power targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).\nA Clear Path to the Target\nTo target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can't be behind total cover. If you place an area of effect\nat a point that you can't see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes\ninto being on the near side of that obstruction.\nTargeting Yourself\nIf a power targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically\na creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a power you cast, you can target yourself. Areas of Effect\nPowers such as singularity and snap freeze cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.\nAreas of Effect\nPowers such as singularity and snap freeze cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.\nA power's description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube,\ncylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the power's energy erupts.\nThe rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in\nspace, but some powers have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.\nA power's effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point\nof origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn't included in the power's area. To block one of\nthese imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.\nCone\nA cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal\nto that point's distance from the point of origin. A cone's area of effect specifies its maximum length.\nA cone's point of origin is not included in the cone's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\nCube\nYou select a cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube's size is expressed as\nthe length of each side.\nA cube's point of origin is not included in the cube's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\nCylinder\nA cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the power description.\nThe circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the power effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight\nlines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The power's effect then\nshoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.\nA cylinder's point of origin is included in the cylinder's area of effect.\nLine\nA line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.\nA line's point of origin is not included in the line's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\nSphere\nYou select a sphere's point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere's size is expressed as\na radius in  that extends from the point.\nA sphere's point of origin is included in the sphere's area of effect.\nSaving Throws\nMany powers specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a power's effects. The power specifies\nthe ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.\nThe DC to resist one of your powers equals 8 + your powercasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.\nAttack Rolls\nSome powers require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the power effect hits the intended target.\nYour attack bonus with a power attack equals your powercasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.\nMost powers that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll\nif you are within  of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn't incapacitated.\nCasting in Armor\nBecause of the mental focus and precise gestures required for powercasting, you must be proficient with the\narmor you are wearing to cast a power. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for powercasting.\n\n",

    "body": "Every operative is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character’s vocation, what special talents he or she\npossesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely to employ when exploring a planet, fighting alien monsters, or engaging\nin a tense negotiation. The character classes are described in the classes section.\nYour character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are class features — capabilities\n(including powercasting) that set your character apart from members of other classes. You also gain a number of\nproficiencies: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of the things\nyour character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.\nOn your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level.\nLevel\nTypically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring and gaining experience points (XP). A\n1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring world, although he or she might have been a soldier or a space pirate\nand done dangerous things before.\nStarting off at 1st level marks your character’s entry into the adventuring life. If you’re already familiar with the\ngame, or if you are joining an existing ME5e campaign, your GM might decide to have you begin at a higher level, on the\nassumption that your character has already survived a few harrowing missions.\nRecord your level on your character sheet. If you’re starting at a higher level, record the additional elements your\nclass gives you for your levels past 1st. Also, record your experience points. A 1st-level character has 0 XP. A higher-level\ncharacter typically begins with the minimum amount of XP required to reach that level (see Beyond 1st Level).\nHit Points and Hit Die\nYour character’s hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hit points\nare determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).\nAt 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your class. You start with hit points equal\nto the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class description. (You also add your Constitution modifier, which\nyou’ll determine in step 3.) This is also your hit point maximum.\nRecord your character’s hit points on your character sheet. Also, record the type of Hit Die your character uses and the\nnumber of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see\nResting in the Missions section).\nProficiency Bonus\nThe table that appears in your class description shows your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level character.\nYour proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you’ll be recording on your character sheet:\n\nAttack rolls using weapons you’re proficient with\nAttack rolls with powers you cast\nAbility checks using skills you’re proficient in\nAbility checks using tools you’re proficient with\nSaving throws you’re proficient in\nSaving throw DCs for powers you cast (explained in each powercasting class)\n\nYour class determines your weapon proficiencies, your saving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill and tool proficiencies.\n(Skills are described in Using Ability Scores, tools\nin Equipment.) Your background gives you additional skill and\ntool proficiencies, and some species give you more proficiencies. Be sure to note all of\nthese proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.\nYour proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. Occasionally, your proficiency\nbonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your\nproficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll or that it should be multiplied more than once, you nevertheless\nadd it only once, multiply it only once, and halve it only once.\nBUILDING KALEEM, STEP 2\nSam imagines Keleem firing tech powers from the safety of cover. She makes Kaleem an engineer and notes the engineers’\nproficiencies and 1st-level class features on her character sheet.\nAs a 1st-level engineer, Kaleem has 1 Hit Die, a d8, and starts with hit points equal to 8 + her Constitution modifier.\nSam notes this and will record the final number after she determines Kaleem’s Constitution score (see step 3). Sam also\nnotes the proficiency bonus for a 1st-level character, which is +2.\n\n",

    "body": "Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword,\na well-placed bullet, or a blast of flame from an incinerate power all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the\nhardiest of creatures.\nHit Points\nHit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more\nhit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.\nA creature's current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature's hit point maximum\ndown to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.\nWhenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on\na creature's capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.\nShield Points. Creatures wearing armor also benefit from shield points described below.\nDamage Rolls\nEach weapon, power, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any\nmodifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage.\nWith a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.\nWhen attacking with a weapon, you add your ability modifier - the same modifier used for the attack roll - to the damage.\nA power tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.\nIf a power or other effect deals damage to more than one target at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them.\nFor example, when an adept casts vortex or an engineer casts flamethrower, the power's damage is rolled once for all\ncreatures caught in the blast.\nCritical Hits\nWhen you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack's damage against the target. Roll all of the\nattack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can\nroll all the damage dice at once.\nFor example, if you score a critical hit with a monomolecular blade, roll 2d10 for the damage, rather than 1d10, and then\nadd your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the infiltrator's Sneak Attack feature,\nyou roll those dice twice as well.\nDamage Types change\nDifferent attacks, damaging powers, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules\nof their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.\nThe damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.\nAcid. The corrosive spray of a chemical and the dissolving enzymes secreted by thresher maw spit deal damage.\nBludgeoning. Blunt force attacks - hammers, falling, constriction, and the like - deal bludgeoning damage.\nCold. The painful chill from a cryo beam breath deal cold damage.\nFire. Many tech powers use plasma and flames to deal fire damage\nForce. One of the primary biotic damage types. Mass effect fields that pummel, pierce, or apply pressure deal force damage.\nLightning. Shock damage. Any damage done by an electrical discharge or source. Deals double damage to shields.\nNecrotic. The second biotic damage type. Necrotic damage uses dark energy and  mass effect fields on a subatomic level.\nPiercing. Puncturing and impaling attacks, including bullets and monsters' bites, deal piercing damage.\nPoison. Venomous stings, poisoned blades, and the toxic gas deal poison damage.\nPsychic. A shock to the nervous system, rather than fear or mental damage. But the latter is possible.\nRadiant. Radiation or damage on a nuclear level, rather than divine light.\nSlashing. Swords, axes, and monsters' claws deal slashing damage.\nThunder. Shockwaves and explosions. Thunder damage is primarily caused by grenades.\nDamage Resistance and Vulnerability\nSome creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.\nIf a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or\nan object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.\nResistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance\nto bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a tech aura\nthat reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.\nMultiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example,\nif a creature has resistance to force damage as well as resistance to biotic damage, the damage of a biotic force damage\nis reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.\nHealing\nUnless it results in death, damage isn't permanent. Even death is reversible through experimental cloning. Rest can\nrestore a creature's hit points, and medical methods such as a medi-gel or first aid power can remove damage in an instant.\nWhen a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature's hit\npoints can't exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, an\nengineer grants a sentinel 8 hit points of healing. If the sentinel has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum\nof 20, the sentinel regains 6 hit points from the engineer, not 8.\nA creature that has died can't regain hit points.\nDropping to 0 Hit Points\nWhen you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.\nInstant Death\nMassive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die\nif the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.\nFor example, a solider with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack,\nshe is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the soldier dies.\nFalling Unconscious\nIf damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious. This unconsciousness ends if you\nregain any hit points.\nDeath Saving Throws\nWhenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to\ndetermine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any\nability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by powers and features that improve your chances of\nsucceeding on a saving throw.\nRoll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself.\nOn your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don't\nneed to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when\nyou regain any hit points or become stable.\nRolling 1 or 20. When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20\non the d20, you regain 1 hit point.\nDamage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If\nthe damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum,\nyou suffer instant death.\nStabilizing a Creature\nThe best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be\nstabilized so that it isn't killed by a failed death saving throw.\nYou can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a\nsuccessful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.\nA stable creature doesn't make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious.\nThe creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable\ncreature that isn't healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.\nMonsters and Death\nMost GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make\ndeath saving throws.\nMighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and\nfollow the same rules as player characters.\nKnocking a Creature Out\nSometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature\nto 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the\ninstant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.\nTemporary Hit Points\nSome powers and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren't actual hit points;\nthey are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.\nWhen you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage\ncarries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the\ntemporary hit points and then take 2 damage.\nBecause temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character\ncan, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.\nHealing can't restore temporary hit points, and they can't be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive\nmore of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a drug grants you\n12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.\nIf you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn't restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can\nstill absorb damage directed at you while you're in that state, but only true healing can save you.\nUnless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they're depleted or you finish a long rest.\n\n",

Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.\nThe six abilities and their use in the game are described in the Using Ability Scores\nsection. The Ability Score Summary provides a quick reference for what qualities are measured by each ability, what species\nincreases which abilities, and what classes consider each ability particularly important.\n\n\nAbility\nMeasures\nImportant For...\n\n\n\n\nStrength\nNatural athleticism, bodily power\nsoldiers, vanguards\n\n\nDexterity\nPhysical agility, reflexes, balance, poise\nsoldiers, infiltrators, engineers\n\n\nConstitution\nHealth, stamina, vital force\neveryone\n\n\nIntelligence\nMental acuity, information recall, analytical skill\nengineer, infiltrator, sentinel\n\n\nWisdom\nAwareness, intuition, insight, biotic capabilities\nadept, vanguard, sentinel\n\n\nCharisma\nConfidence, eloquence, leadership\nasari, performers, politicians\n\n\nYou generate your character’s six ability scores randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest\nthree dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five more times, so that you have six numbers. If you want to save time\nor don’t like the idea of randomly determining ability scores, you can use the following scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.\nNow take your six numbers and write each number beside one of your character’s six abilities to assign scores to\nStrength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to your ability scores\nas a result of your species choice.\nAfter assigning your ability scores, determine your ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table.\nTo determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the result\nby 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each of your scores.\nSee: Rules &gt; Using Ability Scores &gt; Ability Scores and Modifiers\nBUILDING KALEEM, STEP 3\nSam decides to use the standard set of scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) for Kaleem’s abilities. Since she’s an engineer,\nshe puts her highest score, 15, in Intelligence. Her next-highest, 14, goes in Dexterity. Kaleem might be a charismatic,\ngood leader, but Sam decides she wants the salarian to be tougher and stronger than most of her kind, so she puts decent\nscores in Strength and Constitution. After applying her racial benefits (increasing Kaleems’s Intelligence by 2 and her\nDexterity by 1), Kaleem’s ability scores and modifiers look like this: Strength 12 (+1), Dexterity 15 (+2),\nConstitution 13 (+1), Intelligence 17 (+3), Wisdom 10 (0), Charisma 8 (-1).\nSam fills in Kaleem’s final hit points: 8 + her Constitution modifier of +1, for a total of 9 hit points.\nVariant: Customizing Ability Scores\nAt your Galaxy Master’s option, you can use this variant for determining your ability scores. The method described here\nallows you to build a character with a set of ability scores you choose individually.\nYou have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Cost\ntable. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with,\nbefore applying racial increases. You can’t have a score lower than 8.\nThis method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones (15, 15,\n15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any set of numbers\nbetween those extremes.\nAbility Score Point Cost\n\n\nScore\nCost\n\n\n\n\n8\n0\n\n\n9\n1\n\n\n10\n2\n\n\n11\n3\n\n\n12\n4\n\n\n13\n5\n\n\n14\n7\n\n\n15\n9\n\n\n\n",

Other times, different\noperatives do different things: one operative might search a lock box while a second examines an esoteric symbol\nspray-painted on a wall and a third keeps a lookout for thugs. The players don’t need to take turns, but the DM listens\nto every player and decides how to resolve those actions.\nSometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an operative wants to walk across a room and open a door, the GM might just say\nthat the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a tripwire, or some\nother circumstance might make it challenging for an operative to complete a task. In those cases, the GM decides what\nhappens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.\n3. The DM narrates the results of the operatives’ actions.\nDescribing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.\nThis pattern holds, whether the operatives are cautiously exploring a derelict ship, talking to a devious politician, or\nlocked in a firefight against a squad of batarian extremists. In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is\nmore structured and the players (and GM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is\nfluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the mission.\nOften the action of a mission takes place in the imagination of the players and GM, relying on the GM’s verbal\ndescriptions to set the scene. Some GMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many\nplayers and GMs alike adopt different voices for the various operatives, aliens, and other characters they play in the\ngame. Sometimes, a GM might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures to represent each creature involved in a\nscene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.\nGame Dice\nThe game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in many\nbookstores.\nIn these rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12,\nand d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the typical cube that many games use).\nPercentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different\nten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other gives the\nones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100. Some ten-sided dice are\nnumbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit.\nIn this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100.\nWhen you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add.\nFor example, “3d8 + 5” means you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.\nThe same d notation appears in the expressions “1d3” and “1d2.” To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and divide the\nnumber rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending on\nwhether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than half the number of sides on the die, it’s a 2.)\nThe D20\nDoes an operative’s Scimitar shotgun blast hurt a Reaper Brute or just bounce off its iron-hard skin? Will the asari\nbelieve an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging river? Can a character avoid the blast of a fragmentation\ngrenade, or does he or she take full damage from the explosion? In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain,\nthe game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.\nEvery character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six ability scores. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity,\nConstitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for most operatives. (Monsters\nmight have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the ability modifiers derived from them, are\nthe basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character’s or monster’s behalf.\nAbility checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of\nthe game. All three follow these simple steps.\n1. Roll the die and add a modifier.\nRoll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and\nit sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character’s particular skill. (See\nStep-By-Step Characters for details on each ability and how to determine an\nability’s modifier.)\n2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.\nA class feature, a power, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.\n3. Compare the total to a target number.\nIf the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise,\nit’s a failure. The GM is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks,\nattack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.\nThe target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target number for an\nattack roll is called an Armor Class (AC).\nThis simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in D&amp;D play. Using Ability Scores\nprovides more detailed rules for using the d20 in the game.\nAdvantage and Disadvantage\nSometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modified by special situations called advantage and disadvantage.\nAdvantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite. When you\nhave either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if\nyou have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17\nand a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.\nMore detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are presented in the\nUsing Ability Scores section.\nSpecific Beats General\nThis compendium contains rules that govern how the game plays. That said, many racial traits, class features, powers,\ngadgets, monster abilities, and other game elements break the general rules in some way, creating an exception to how\nthe rest of the game works. Remember this: If a specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.\nExceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, many operatives don’t have proficiency with shotguns, but every\nsoldier does because of a class trait. That trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other examples of rule-breaking\nare more conspicuous. For instance, an operative can’t normally fly, but some powers and armor mods make that possible.\nBiotics and tech account for most of the major exceptions to the rules.\nRound Down\nThere’s one more general rule you need to know at the outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round down if you\nend up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.\n\n",

    "body": "The Dungeons &amp; Dragons roleplaying game is about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery and Mass Effect 5e\ntakes that storytelling to the stars. Both share elements with childhood games of make-believe. Like those games,\nMass Effect 5e is driven by imagination. It’s about picturing the alien landscape beneath the two-sunned sky and imagining how an\nN7 soldier might react to the challenges that scene presents.\nGalaxy Master (GM): You arrived on Asteroid 2179 JK178 on a UT-47 Kodiak. Approaching the station’s hangar, a missile\nlock alarm sounds in the cockpit. Your pilot, Harcourt Finn, immediately took evasive action and put down on the opposite\nside of the asteroid. Scans indicate the automated defense system should extend around the entire asteroid but appears\nto be dormant on the side opposite the station entrance. Having no other options, you double-checked the pressure seals\non your armor and set out on foot across the asteroid’s surface. After a quick 3 kilometer jaunt, you arrive at the edge\nof the asteroid. Looking down, you can see the hangar doors sealed tight. You’ll have to find another way in …\n\nAmanda (playing Melphine): I want to scan the area for movement or any immediate threats.\n\nAmie (playing Telos): The drop to the hanger door looks pretty far? I want to test how much gravity the asteroid has.\nDo I think we can easily drop down to it without injuring ourselves or flying off into space?\nUnlike a game of make-believe, Mass Effect 5e gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the operatives’\naction. Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their operatives can scale a cliff,\nroll away from the strike of a biotic attack, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible,\nbut the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.\nGalaxy Master (GM): OK, one at a time. Amanda, you’re looking for threats?\n\nAmanda: Yeah. Is there any movement in the area?\n\nGM: Make a Wisdom check.\n\nAmanda: Does my Perception skill apply?\n\nGM: Of course!\n\nAmanda (rolling a d20): Rats. I rolled a six, plus two for my perception skill modifier. So, Eight.\n\nGM: No movement that you can see. And Amie, Telos is assessing the drop to the hanger bay?\nIn the Mass Effect 5e game, each player creates an operative (also called a character) and teams up with other\noperatives (played by friends). Working together, the group might explore a derelict starship, the slums of an inhabited asteroid,\nthe glorious streets of an advanced civilization, an ancient temple deep in a jungle, or the steppes of a mining colony.\nThe operatives can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle alien monsters, and discover advanced technologies\nand relics from a past age.\nOne player, however, takes on the role of the Galaxy Master (GM), the game’s lead storyteller and referee. The GM creates\nmissions for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The GM might describe the\nentrance to Osiris Station, and the players decide what they want their operatives to do. Will they jump down to the hanger bay?\nPropel themselves with jetpacks? Or use a biotic's powers to increase their mass, &quot;affixing&quot; themselves to the surface of\nthe asteroid? Then the GM determines the results of the operatives’ actions and narrates what they experience. Because the GM\ncan improvise to react to anything the players attempt, Mass Effect 5e is infinitely flexible, and each\nmission can be exciting and unexpected.\nThe game has no real end; when one story or mission wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a\ncampaign. Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends\nevery week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The operatives grow in might as the campaign continues. Each\nmonster defeated, each mission completed, and each gadget recovered not only adds to the continuing story but also\nearns the operatives new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by an operative’s level.\nThere’s no winning and losing in the Mass Effect 5e game—at least, not the way those terms are usually understood.\nTogether, the GM and the players create an exciting story of bold operatives who confront deadly perils. Sometimes an\noperative might come to a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious rachni or done in by a nefarious Cerberus assassin. Even so,\nthe other operatives can search for breaking-edge medical experiments to revive (or clone!) their fallen comrade, or the\nplayer might choose to create a new character to carry on. The group might fail to complete a mission successfully,\nbut if everyone had a good time and created a memorable story, they all win.\n\n",

A\nwretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched\npeople covet your armor, weapons, and gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice\nof most people.\nSqualid. You live in the slums, a condemned building, a repurposed shipping container, or a roach-infested boarding\nhouse in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent\nenvironment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you\nhave few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be\ndisturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.\nPoor. A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings,\nthreadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your\naccommodations might be a room in a rundown apartment, the basement dwelling of a business, or the bunker of a faction.\nYou benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this\nlifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.\nModest. A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in\nan older part of the city, renting a room in a crowded apartment. You don't go hungry or thirsty, and your living\nconditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students,\nservice workers.\nComfortable. Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your\nequipment. You live in a nice apartment in a middle-class neighborhood or in a small townhouse. You associate with\nshopkeepers, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.\nWealthy. Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social\nstatus associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly\nsuccessful small business owner, a politician, or a doctor. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a\ngood part of town or a comfortable suite at the top level of an apartment building. You likely have a small staff of workers\nto maintain your home or run day to day errands.\nAristocratic. You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in\nthe community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a mansion in the nicest part of town or a luxurious suite. You dine\nat the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have workers attending to your every need.\nYou receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful and spend evenings in the company of politicians,\ncommunity leaders, and other elite persons. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The\nwealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.\nSelf Sufficiency\nThe expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are spending your time between adventures on an advanced planet\nin a city or town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford - paying for food and lodging, paying\nskilled workers to mend your armor or service your weapons, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend\ntheir time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.\nMaintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn't require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your\ntime between adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle.

    "link": "manual/combat#making-an-attack",
    "body": "Whether you're striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a power, an\nattack has a simple structure.\n\nChoose a target. Pick a target within your attack's range: a creature, an object, or a location.\nDetermine modifiers. The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage\nagainst the target. In addition, powers, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.\nResolve the attack. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules\nthat specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.\n\nIf there's ever any question whether something you're doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you're making an\nattack roll, you're making an attack.\nAttack Rolls\nWhen you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a\nd20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class\n(AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its\nstat block.\nModifiers to the Roll\nWhen a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character's\nproficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.\n_Ability Modifier. The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for\na ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse, thrown, or recoil property break this rule. Some powers\nalso require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a power attack depends on the powercasting ability of the powercaster.\nProficiency Bonus. You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you\nhave proficiency, as well as when you attack with a power.\nRolling 1 or 20\nSometimes lady luck blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.\nIf the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. This is called a\ncritical hit, which is explained later in this chapter.\nIf the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC.\nUnseen Attackers and Targets\nCombatants often try to escape their foes' notice by hiding, casting tactical cloak, or lurking in darkness.\nWhen you attack a target that you can't see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you're guessing\nthe target's location or you're targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in the location you\ntargeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the\ntarget's location correctly.\nWhen a creature can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden - -both unseen and\nunheard - when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.\nRanged Attacks\nWhen you make a ranged attack, you fire a gun or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might\nshoot spines from its tail. Many powers also involve making a ranged attack.\nRange\nYou can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.\nIf a ranged attack, such as one made with a power, has a single range, you can't attack a target beyond this range.\nSome ranged attacks, such as those made with a gun, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger\nnumber is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can't attack\na target beyond the long range.\nRanged Attacks in Close Combat\nAiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a power,\nor some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within  of a hostile creature who can\nsee you and who isn't incapacitated.\nMelee Attacks\nUsed in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a\nhandheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an omni-tool. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes\nwith its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few powers also involve making a melee attack.\nMost creatures have a 2-meter reach and can thus attack targets within  of them when making a melee attack. Certain\ncreatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than , as noted in their descriptions.\nInstead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar\nforceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your\nStrength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.\nGun strikes new\nInstead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use your ranged weapon, hitting a target with the butt of\nthe gun. On a hit, a gun strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with\ngun strikes if you are proficient with the type of gun.\nOpportunity Attacks\nIn a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a\nstrike is called an opportunity attack.\nYou can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the\nopportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs\nright before the creature leaves your reach.\nYou can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don't provoke an opportunity\nattack when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don't provoke\nan opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe's reach or if an adept lifts you off the ground with Pull.\nTwo-Weapon Fighting\nWhen you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a\nbonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You don't add your\nability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.\nIf either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.\nContests in Combat\nBattle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This\nsection includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The\nGM can use these contests as models for improvising others.\nGrappling\nWhen you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple.\nIf you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\nThe target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least\none free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics)\ncheck contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use).\nIf you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled. The condition specifies the things that end it,\nand you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).\nEscaping a Grapple. A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics)\nor Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.\nMoving a Grappled Creature. When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is\nhalved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.\nShoving a Creature\nUsing the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it\naway from you. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\nThe target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll,\nyou make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check\n(the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it \naway from you.\n\n",

    "body": "The game consists of a group of characters embarking on a mission that the Galaxy Master presents to them. Each\ncharacter brings particular capabilities to the mission in the form of ability scores and skills, class features,\nracial traits, equipment, and gadgets. Every character is different, with various strengths and weaknesses, so the best\nparty of operatives is one in which the characters complement each other and cover the weaknesses of their companions.\nThe operatives must cooperate to successfully complete the mission.\nThe mission is the heart of the game, a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. a mission features a fantastic\nsetting, whether it’s the ruins of an ancient civilization, an asteroid, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It\nfeatures a rich cast of characters: the operatives created and played by the other players at the table, as well as\nnonplayer characters (NPCs). Those characters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background extras\nin a mission. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of a mission’s action.\nOver the course of their missions, the characters are confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situations\nthat they must deal with in some way. Sometimes the operatives and other creatures do their best to kill or capture\neach other in combat. At other times, the operatives talk to another creature (or even an AI) with a goal in mind. And\noften, the operatives spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle, find something hidden, or unravel the\ncurrent situation. All along, the operatives explore the galaxy, making decisions about which way to travel and what\nthey’ll try to do next.\nAissions vary in length and complexity. A short mission might present only a few challenges, and it might take no\nmore than a single game session to complete. A long mission can involve hundreds of combats, interactions, and other\nchallenges, and take dozens of sessions to play through, stretching over weeks or months of real time. Usually, the end\nof a mission is marked by the operatives heading back to some form of 'home base' to rest and enjoy the spoils of\ntheir labors.\nBut that’s not the end of the story. You can think of a mission as a single episode of a TV series, made up of\nmultiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole series—a string of missions joined together, with a consistent group\nof operatives following the narrative from start to finish.\nThe Three Pillars of a mission\nExploration includes both the operatives’ movement through the world and their interaction with objects and situations\nthat require their attention. Exploration is the give-and-take of the players describing what they want their characters\nto do, and the Galaxy Master telling the players what happens as a result. On a large scale, that might involve the\ncharacters spending a day crossing an icy plain or an hour making their way through tunnels of city's transit tube. On\nthe smallest scale, it could mean one character pushing a button on the console to see what happens.\nSocial interaction features the operatives talking to someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding that a\ncaptured soldier reveal the passcode to the enemy's stronghold, getting information from a rescued prisoner, pleading for\nmercy from a krogan chieftain, or persuading a talkative unshackled AI to unlock a navigation route to a distant planet.\nThe rules in Using Ability Scores and\nMissions support exploration\nand social interaction.\nCombat, the focus of the Combat section, involves characters and other creatures\nshooting weapons, casting biotics and tech, maneuvering for position, and so on—all in an effort to defeat their opponents,\nwhether that means killing every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat is the most structured element of a\ngame session, with creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets a chance to act. Even in the context of a\npitched battle, there’s still plenty of opportunity for operatives to attempt wacky stunts like surfing on a drone,\nto examine the environment (perhaps by pushing a very large red button), and to interact with other creatures,\nincluding allies, enemies, and neutral parties.\n\n",

    "body": "In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your\nturn, following the rules here.\nYour movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking,\nor they can constitute your entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your\nspeed until it is used up or until you are done moving.\nBreaking Up Your Move\nYou can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you\nhave a speed of , you can move , take your action, and then move .\nMoving between Attacks\nIf you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving\nbetween those attacks. For example, a soldier who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed\nof  could move , make an attack, , and then attack again.\nUsing Different Speeds\nIf you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your\nspeeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result\ndetermines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move.\nFor example, if you have a speed of  and a flying speed of  because\nyou're wearing a jetpack, you could fly ,\nthen walk , and then leap into the air to fly  more.\nDifficult Terrain\nCombat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous\nstaircases - the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.\nEvery meter of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra meter. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space\ncount as difficult terrain.\nLow furniture, crates, trash cans, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult\nterrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.\nBeing Prone\nCombatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves\ndown. In the game, they are prone. You can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes\nmore effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is , you must\nspend  of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.\nTo move while prone, you must crawl. Every foot of movement while crawling costs .\nCrawling  in difficult terrain, therefore, costs  of movement.\nInteracting with Objects\nAround You Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:\n\ndraw or sheathe a sword\nopen or close a door\nwithdraw a medi-gel from your armor\npick up a dropped weapon\ntake a datapad from a table\nremove your helmet\nstuff some food into your mouth\nplant a banner in the ground\ndrink all the ale in a flagon\nthrow a lever or a switch\nextinguish a small flame\nput your ear to a door\nkick a small stone\ntap the floor with your weapon\nhand an item to another character\n\nMoving Around Other Creatures\nYou can move through a nonhostile creature's space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's space only if\nthe creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature's space is difficult terrain for you.\nWhether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space.\nIf you leave a hostile creature's reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later.\nFlying Movement\nFlying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature\nis knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless\nit has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by biotics, such as by the fly power.\nCreature Size\nEach creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a\nparticular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.\n\n\nSize\nSpace\n\n\n\n\nTiny\n by \n\n\nSmall\n by \n\n\nMedium\n by \n\n\nLarge\n by \n\n\nHuge\n by \n\n\nGargantuan\n by  or larger\n\n\nSpace\nA creature's space is the area in  that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical\ndimensions. A typical Medium creature isn't  wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a\nMedium asari stands in a -wide doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the asari lets them.\nA creature's space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there's a limit to the number\nof creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a \nradius around another one.\nBecause larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around\na Medium or smaller one, there's little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround\na Gargantuan one.\nSqueezing into a Smaller Space\nA creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature\ncan squeeze through a passage that's only  wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra\nmeter for every meter it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls\nagainst the creature have advantage while it's in the smaller space.\n\n",

    "body": "Spacewalking along the surface of an asteroid, sneaking down a space station corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain\nslope - all sorts of movement play a key role in fantasy gaming adventures.\nThe GM can summarize the operatives' movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: &quot;You travel through\nthe dusty desert of Turchanka and find a small outpost late in the evening of the third day.&quot; Even in a space station,\nparticularly a large station or an asteroid colony, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: &quot;After subduing the\nguards at the entrance to the underground research facility, you consult your omni-tool, which leads you through\nmiles of echoing corridors to a large arena with caged varren.&quot;\nSometimes it's important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in\ndays, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the\ncreatures moving and the terrain they're moving over.\nSpeed change\nEvery character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in  that the character or monster can walk in 1 round.\nThis number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation. The following rules\ndetermine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.\nBy default, Mass Effect 5e uses meters instead of feet. You can toggle to imperial measurements at the bottom of the left-hand navigation.\n5ft = 2m\nOn a playmat: 2m = 1 square\nTravel Pace\nWhile traveling, a group of operatives can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The\ntable states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes\ncharacters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.\nForced March\nThe Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in a day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.\nFor each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace,\nand each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours.\nOn a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion.\nMounts and Vehicles\nFor short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted\ncharacter can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are\navailable every  to , characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very\nrare except in densely populated areas.\nCharacters in transports choose a pace as normal. The range statistic on transports indicates how far the transport can\ntravel in a 24 hour period for a normal pace. If you're moving at a fast pace, you can double the range and half it for a\nslow pace. Transports do not suffer exhaustion as a living mount would, but characters still need to pilot the vehicle.\nIn general, characters can only pilot vehicle for 16 hours at a time before needing to rest.\nMore details about traveling in transports and starships are provided in the vehicles section.\n\n\nPace\nper Minute\nper Hour\nper Day\nEffect\n\n\n\n\nFast\n\n\n\n-5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores\n\n\nNormal\n\n\n\n-\n\n\nSlow\n\n\n\nAble to use stealth\n\n\nDifficult Terrain\nThe travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear corridors.\nBut operatives can face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled craters, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground -\nall considered difficult terrain.\nYou move at half speed in difficult terrain - moving  in difficult terrain costs  of speed - so you can\ncover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.\nSpecial Types of Movement\nMovement through underground tunnels, skyscrapers, or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Operatives\nmight have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.\nClimbing, Swimming, and Crawling\nWhile climbing or swimming, each meter of movement costs \n( in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed.\nAt the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics)\ncheck. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.\nJumping change\nYour Strength determines how far you can jump.\nLong Jump. When you make a long jump, you cover a number of  up to your Strength score ,\nif you move at least  on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance.\nEither way, each  you clear on the jump costs a  of movement.\nThis rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM's option,\nyou must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance),\nsuch as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.\nWhen you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.\nHigh Jump. When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of  equal to 3 + your Strength modifier\n if you move at least \non foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can\njump only half that distance. Either way, each  you clear on the jump costs a  of movement. In some circumstances,\nyour GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.\nYou can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal\nto the height of the jump plus 1 1/2 times your height.\n+/- Gravity new\nOperatives may find themselves in an environment with little, no, or increased gravity. For any increase (or decrease) that\nis twice as more (or less) than your operatives normal working gravity, use the difficult terrain rules. I.e., if your\noperative normally works in a 1g environment, and enters a .5g or 2g environment, they are considered to be in difficult terrain.\nIf you're in a low gravity environment, your long and high jump distances are doubled. Jump distances are halved in higher\ngravity.\nWhen in a 0g environment, your speed becomes 0, unless you have a means of propelling yourself. Additional rules, such as\ndisadvantage on Dexterity saving throws or melee attacks, are decided by the GM based on the context of your environment.\n\n",

    "body": "Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to\nrealize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.\nWith this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining\na level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For\nexample, if you have three levels in engineer and two in sentinel, you're a 5th-level character.\nAs you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another\nclass, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start\nprogressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you'll sacrifice some\nfocus in exchange for versatility.\nPrerequisites\nTo qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your\nnew one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a vanguard who decides to multiclass into\nthe infiltrator class must have both Dexterity and Intelligence scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training\nthat a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that\nis reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.\nMulticlassing Prerequisites\n\n\nClass\nAbility Score Minimum\n\n\n\n\nAdept\nWisdom 13\n\n\nEngineer\nIntelligence 13\n\n\nInfiltrator\nDexterity 13 and Intelligence 13\n\n\nSentinel\nIntelligence 13 or Wisdom 13\n\n\nSoldier\nStrength 13 or Dexterity 13\n\n\nVanguard\nStrength 13 and Wisdom 13\n\n\nExperience Points\nThe experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character\nAdvancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are an engineer 6/adept 1, you must gain enough XP\nto reach 8th level before you can take your second level as an adept or your seventh level as an engineer.\nHit Points and Hit Dice\nYou gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a\nclass only when you are a 1st-level character.\nYou add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same\ndie type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the sentinel and the soldier have a d10, so if you are a\nsentinel 5/soldier 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them\nseparately. If you are a sentinel 5/vanguard 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d12 Hit Dice.\nProficiency Bonus\nYour proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class. For example,\nif you are a soldier 3/infiltrator 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.\nProficiencies\nWhen you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class's starting\nproficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.\nMulticlassing Proficiencies\n\n\nClass\nProficiencies Gained\n\n\n\n\nAdept\nSMGs\n\n\nEngineer\nAssault Rifles, Medium Armor\n\n\nInfiltrator\nSniper Rifles and Melee Weapons\n\n\nSentinel\nMedium Armor, Heavy Armor, and choose 1 weapon type from Assault Rifles, Melee, Shotguns, or SMGs\n\n\nSoldier\n2 weapon types, Medium Armor, Heavy Armor\n\n\nVanguard\nShotguns, Medium Armor\n\n\nClass Features\nWhen you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's\nstarting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Barrier, Extra Attack, and Powercasting.\nBarrier new\nYour barrier capacity depends partly on your combined levels in all your powercasting classes and partly on your\nindividual levels in those classes. You determine your barrier capacity by adding together all your levels in the\nvanguard class and half your levels (rounded down) in the adept and sentinel classes.

You can't make\nmore than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the soldier's version of Extra Attack does).\nPowercasting change\nPowers known and prepared: You determine what powers you know and can prepare for each class individually as if you were a single-classed member\nof that class. If you are an adept 4/engineer 3, for example, you know six 1st-level adept powers and five adept cantrips\nbased on your levels in the adept class. As a 3rd-level engineer, you can prepare 3 engineer powers. If your Intelligence\nis 16, you can prepare six engineer powers.\nEach power you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the powercasting ability of that\nclass when you cast the power.\nYou can only use power slots to cast biotic powers and you can only use tech points to cast tech powers. The exception\nis Sentinels that can use their power slots to cast biotic or tech powers.\nBiotic Power Slots: You determine your available power slots and cantrips by adding together all your\nlevels in the adept class and half your levels (rounded down) in the sentinel and vanguard classes.

    "body": "Omni-tools are handheld devices that combine a computer microframe, sensor analysis pack, and minifacturing fabricator.\nThe fabrication module can rapidly assemble small three-dimensional objects from common, reusable industrial plastics,\nceramics, and light alloys. This allows for field repairs and modifications to most standard items, as well as the\nreuse of salvaged equipment.\nMost omni-tools come with a standard set of functionality, including scanning, remote interfacing, and some fabricator\ndesigns.  However, there exist in the galaxy a number of advanced omni-tool programs that are not available for the general\npopulation's consumption. These programs tend to be of military design, experimental hacks or deprecated programs\nthat have been scrubbed from the exonet.\nInstallation\nSome omni-tool programs require an operative to integrate the module into the tool's microframe before the benefits can\nbe used. This process is called Installation, and certain programs have a prerequisite for it.\nInstallation requires an operative to spend a short rest focused on only installing and debugging the program. If the short\nrest is interrupted, the installation attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the operative gains the\nbenefits of the program.\nA program can be installed to only one omni-tool at a time. Almost all programs come with a powerful DRM and security\nsystem that prevents the program being installed on multiple omni-tools or replicated. Interestingly,\nbefore the humans were granted an embassy on the Citadel in 2165, the concept of digital rights management was foreign to\nthe other species of the galaxy. But since 2165, omni-tool programs have been locked down. Attempting to hack the DRM\ngenerally has a terrible result.\nAn omni-tool can only have three programs activated at once. Any attempt to install to a fourth program fails; the operative\nmust first uninstall the program from their tool (this also takes a short rest). Once uninstalled, the program can be\ntraded and installed on a separated tool. Additionally, omni-tools can't have more than one copy of a program installed.\nSingle-Use Programs\nManufacturers and militaries quickly realized it was much easier, cheaper, faster, and (usually) safer to send bits of\ndata rather than physical products, and let fabricators generate the devices on site using generic materials, like omni-gel.\nAfter the advent of omni-tools, a number of industries used this method to ship their products. However, to avoid\nunauthorized replication, the programs would scrub themselves once the job was complete.\nOmni-tool programs that don't require installation are single-use and cost a number of omni-gel to create the final product.\nOnce used, the program is completely wiped. As with installed programs, attempts to recreate these pieces of code can be\ncostly, even deadly.\nUnstable Programs\nUnstable Programs are entirely experimental, therefore the number of times you can run the program varies widely. In some\ncases, unstable programs are single-use programs that are hacked for multiple uses. A GM can create an Unstable Program\nfrom a Single-Use program by assigning a die roll (d4, d6, etc) to the number of times the program can be used.\n",

    "body": "Fleshing out your character’s personality — the array of traits, mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give a person\na unique identity — will help you bring him or her to life as you play the game. Four categories of characteristics are\npresented here: personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about your character’s\nfavorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you can imagine.\nEach background presented later in this section includes suggested characteristics that you can use to spark your\nimagination. You’re not bound to those options, but they’re a good starting point.\nPersonality Traits\nGive your character two personality traits. Personality traits are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart\nfrom every other character. Your personality traits should tell you something interesting and fun about your character.\nThey should be self-descriptions that are specific about what makes your character stand out.\n“I’m smart” is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. “I’ve read every book in on the Exonet” tells\nyou something specific about your character’s interests and disposition.\nPersonality traits might describe the things your character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your character\ndislikes or fears, your character’s self-attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability scores.\nA useful place to start thinking about personality traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and define\none trait related to each. Either one could be positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a low score, for example,\nor be cocky about your high score.\nIdeals\nDescribe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals are the things that you believe in most strongly, the fundamental\nmoral and ethical principles that compel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life goals to your core belief system.\nIdeals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that you will never betray? What would prompt you to\nmake sacrifices? What drives you to act and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single most important thing you strive for?\nYou can choose any ideals you like, but your character’s alignment is a good place to start defining them. Each background\nincludes six suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: law, chaos, good, evil, and neutrality.\nThe last one has more to do with the particular background than with moral or ethical perspectives.\nBonds\nCreate one bond for your character. Bonds represent a character’s connections to people, places, and events in the world.\nThey tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you to act against\nyour own best interests if they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a character’s motivations\nand goals.\nBonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do you care most about? To what place do you feel a special connection?\nWhat is your most treasured possession?\nYour bonds might be tied to your class, your background, your species, or some other aspect of your character’s history or\npersonality. You might also gain new bonds over the course of your missions.\nFlaws\nFinally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character’s flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness —\nin particular, anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against your best interests.\nMore significant than negative personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these questions: What enrages you?\nWhat’s the one person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What are your vices?\nBUILDING KALEEM, STEP 4.D\nSam has a pretty clear picture of Kaleem’s personality in mind, so she skips the personality traits suggested in the scrapper\nbackground, noting instead that Kaleem is aloof and soft-spoken. She is distrustful of strangers but fiercely loyal to her friends.\nShe chooses the ideal of change from the list in her background, noting that Kaleem believes that the only constant in the universe\nis change.\nGiven her history, Kaleem’s bond is obvious: she owes her life to the Blue Suns. Her flaw is that she lacks empathy which\nhas caused her to do some morally questionable deeds without thinking twice.\n\n",

Whether on\na starship or a soldier's suit of armor, the basic principle remains the same. Kinetic barriers are repulsive mass effect\nfields projected from tiny emitters. These shields safely deflect small objects traveling at rapid velocities. This\naffords protection from bullets and other dangerous projectiles but still allows the user to sit down without knocking\naway their chair. The shielding afforded by kinetic barriers does not protect against extremes of temperature, toxins,\nor radiation.\nShield Points\nShield points are a special type of regenerating hit points that protect your from fast-moving projectiles and provide\nadvantage in certain situations against some tech and biotic powers.\nShield devices\nAll armor chest pieces come standard with 5 shield points and a regen of 5. However, more advanced mods and armor\nsets can provide additional shields. Additionally, personal shield generators are available which can provide shields\nwithout the operative equipping armor.\nDamage\nWhen you have shield points and take damage, the shield points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to\nyour normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 shield points and take 7 damage, you lose the shield points and then\ntake 2 damage. Some abilities &quot;bypass&quot; your shield points. In these instances, you subtract damage from your\nhit points leaving your shield points unchanged.\nMelee Weapons\nAll damage resulting from a melee weapon attacks bypass shield points.\nShield Regeneration\nYour armor's shield points are managed by the onboard VI, which is taxed during combat as it manages other systems: your\nomni-tool or biotic implant, HUD, etc. Thus, once a threat is properly neutralized, or you are able to temporarily remove\nyourself from the fray, your VI can route power back into your shields for immediate regeneration.\nOut of combat\nYour shield points regenerate completely on a short or long rest or when combat has ended for at least 1 minute.\nIn combat\nTo attempt to regenerate your shields during combat, you must attempt to remove yourself from the chaos, meeting one of\nthe following conditions on your turn:\n\nTake the Hide action\nTake the Dodge action\nTake the Disengage action\nHave full cover at the end of your turn\n\nThen, if you take no damage until the start of your next turn, your shields begin to regenerate and you gain shield\npoints equal to your armor's regen stat. You continue to gain shield points equal to your regen stat at the start of each\nof your turns. If you take damage or you reach your maximum shield point capacity, the regeneration ends.\nSHIELD REGENERATION EXAMPLE\nTodd is playing human vanguard name Todd who has invested heavily in his armor's shields, giving him 20 shield points\nwith a regen of 10. Todd rushes into a Reaper hoard of marauders who unleash a volley of bullets at him, bringing his\nshields to 4. On his turn, Todd thinks better of his actions and decides to take the Dodge action, ducking behind a crate.\nSome marauders lose sight of Todd, others attempt to hit him again, but are unsuccessful. At the start of Todd's turn,\nhe has taken no damage since the end of his last turn and his shields begin to regenerate, immediately gaining 10 shield points.\nTodd now has 14 shield points total. Todd takes his turn as he normally would.\nAn adept spots Todd and hits him with a Warp power. This bypasses Todd's shields and deals 13 necrotic damage. But it\ndoes not end his shield regeneration. If this damage had been from an Assault Rifle or an Incinerate power, Todd's shield\nregeneration would have ended.\nOn Todd's next turn, he gains another 10 shield points, putting him back to his maximum capacity of 20 and the regeneration\nends.\nLightning Damage\nAll shields are vulnerable to lightning damage. In the event that a lighting attack removes all shield points, the\nfollowing steps outline how to divvy up the damage:\n\nDouble the lightning damage done to the target.\nSubtract the shield points from the total damage.\nReduce the remaining damage by half\nApply the new amount to the target's hit points.\n\n",

    "body": "Exploring planets, overcoming obstacles, and surviving death squads are key parts of Mass Effect missions. No less important,\nthough, are the social interactions that operatives have with other inhabitants of the galaxy.\nInteraction takes on many forms. You might need to convince an unscrupulous spy to confess to some malfeasance, or you\nmight try to flatter a shop owner so they will give you a discount. The GM assumes the roles of any characters who are\nparticipating in the interaction that don’t belong to another player at the table. Any such character is called a\nnonplayer character (NPC).\nIn general terms, an NPC’s attitude toward you is described as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly NPCs are\npredisposed to help you, and hostile ones are inclined to get in your way. It’s easier to get what you want from a\nfriendly NPC, of course.\nSocial interactions have two primary aspects: roleplaying and ability checks.\nRoleplaying\nRoleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this case, it’s you as a player determining how your character\nthinks, acts, and talks.\nRoleplaying is a part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the fore during social interactions. Your character’s\nquirks, mannerisms, and personality influence how interactions resolve.\nThere are two styles you can use when roleplaying your character: the descriptive approach and the active approach. Most\nplayers use a combination of the two styles. Use whichever mix of the two works best for you.\nDescriptive Approach to Roleplaying\nWith this approach, you describe your character’s words and actions to the GM and the other players. Drawing on your mental\nimage of your character, you tell everyone what your character does and how he or she does it.\nWhen using descriptive roleplaying, keep the following things in mind:\n\nDescribe your character’s emotions and attitude.\nFocus on your character’s intent and how others might perceive it.\nProvide as much embellishment as you feel comfortable with.\nDon’t worry about getting things exactly right. Just focus on thinking about what your character would do and describing\nwhat you see in your mind.\n\nActive Approach to Roleplaying\nIf descriptive roleplaying tells your GM and your fellow players what your character thinks and does, active roleplaying\nshows them.\nWhen you use active roleplaying, you speak with your character’s voice, like an actor taking on a role. You might even\necho your character’s movements and body language. This approach is more immersive than descriptive roleplaying, though\nyou still need to describe things that can’t be reasonably acted out.\nResults of Roleplaying\nThe GM uses your character’s actions and attitudes to determine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly NPC buckles under threats\nof violence. A stubborn turian refuses to let anyone badger her. A vain asari laps up flattery.\nWhen interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to the GM’s portrayal of the NPC’s mood, dialogue, and personality.\nYou might be able to determine an NPC’s personality traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds, then play on them to influence\nthe NPC’s attitude.\nInteractions in Mass Effect 5e are much like interactions in real life. If you can offer NPCs something they want, threaten\nthem with something they fear, or play on their sympathies and goals, you can use words to get almost anything you want.\nOn the other hand, if you insult a proud warrior or speak ill of a politician’s allies, your efforts to convince or\ndeceive will fall short.\nAbility Checks\nIn addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in determining the outcome of an interaction.\nYour roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC’s attitude, but there might still be an element of chance in the situation.\nFor example, your GM can call for a Charisma check at any point during an interaction if he or she wants the dice to play\na role in determining an NPC’s reactions. Other checks might be appropriate in certain situations, at your GM’s discretion.\nPay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking of how you want to interact with an NPC, and stack the deck in\nyour favor by using an approach that relies on your best bonuses and skills. If the group needs to trick a security guard\ninto letting them into a classified area, the infiltrator who is proficient in Deception is the best bet to lead the\ndiscussion. When negotiating for a hostage’s release, the sentinel with Persuasion should do most of the talking.\n\n",

The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the\ncreatures moving and the terrain they're moving over.\nSpeed change\nEvery character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in  that the character or monster can walk in 1 round.\nThis number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation. The following rules\ndetermine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.\nBy default, Mass Effect 5e uses meters instead of feet. You can toggle to imperial measurements at the bottom of the left-hand navigation.\n5ft = 2m\nOn a playmat: 2m = 1 square\nTravel Pace\nWhile traveling, a group of operatives can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The\ntable states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes\ncharacters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.\nForced March\nThe Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in a day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.\nFor each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace,\nand each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours.\nOn a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion.\nMounts and Vehicles\nFor short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted\ncharacter can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are\navailable every  to , characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very\nrare except in densely populated areas.\nCharacters in transports choose a pace as normal. The range statistic on transports indicates how far the transport can\ntravel in a 24 hour period for a normal pace. If you're moving at a fast pace, you can double the range and half it for a\nslow pace. Transports do not suffer exhaustion as a living mount would, but characters still need to pilot the vehicle.\nIn general, characters can only pilot vehicle for 16 hours at a time before needing to rest.\nMore details about traveling in transports and starships are provided in the vehicles section.\n\n\nPace\nper Minute\nper Hour\nper Day\nEffect\n\n\n\n\nFast\n\n\n\n-5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores\n\n\nNormal\n\n\n\n-\n\n\nSlow\n\n\n\nAble to use stealth\n\n\nDifficult Terrain\nThe travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear corridors.\nBut operatives can face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled craters, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground -\nall considered difficult terrain.\nYou move at half speed in difficult terrain - moving  in difficult terrain costs  of speed - so you can\ncover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.\nSpecial Types of Movement\nMovement through underground tunnels, skyscrapers, or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Operatives\nmight have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.\nClimbing, Swimming, and Crawling\nWhile climbing or swimming, each meter of movement costs \n( in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed.\nAt the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics)\ncheck. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.\nJumping change\nYour Strength determines how far you can jump.\nLong Jump. When you make a long jump, you cover a number of  up to your Strength score ,\nif you move at least  on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance.\nEither way, each  you clear on the jump costs a  of movement.\nThis rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM's option,\nyou must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance),\nsuch as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.\nWhen you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.\nHigh Jump. When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of  equal to 3 + your Strength modifier\n if you move at least \non foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can\njump only half that distance. Either way, each  you clear on the jump costs a  of movement. In some circumstances,\nyour GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.\nYou can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal\nto the height of the jump plus 1 1/2 times your height.\n+/- Gravity new\nOperatives may find themselves in an environment with little, no, or increased gravity. For any increase (or decrease) that\nis twice as more (or less) than your operatives normal working gravity, use the difficult terrain rules. I.e., if your\noperative normally works in a 1g environment, and enters a .5g or 2g environment, they are considered to be in difficult terrain.\nIf you're in a low gravity environment, your long and high jump distances are doubled. Jump distances are halved in higher\ngravity.\nWhen in a 0g environment, your speed becomes 0, unless you have a means of propelling yourself. Additional rules, such as\ndisadvantage on Dexterity saving throws or melee attacks, are decided by the GM based on the context of your environment.\n\n",

A power's level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the\nlowly (but still impressive) lance at 1st level and the earth-shaking Storm at 4th. Cantrips - simple but powerful powers\nthat characters can cast almost by rote - are level 0. The higher a power's level, the higher level a powercaster must\nbe to use that power. All combat powers are considered cantrips.\nPower level and character level don't correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level,\nnot 5th level, to cast a 5th-level power.\nCombat Cantrips new\nCombat powers are a special type of cantrip, that are more powerful than biotic cantrips. Combat powers have limitations\nin the number of times you can use them per short and long rest. Certain classes (infiltrators and vanguards) have the\noption of learning combat powers instead of cantrips, as indicated in their class descriptions.\nMany Combat powers have an action cost of Attack. This means you must use the Attack combat action to cast the power. If\na power or effect prevents you from taking the Attack action, you cannot cast the power.\n",

Thus, each biotic class's description includes a table showing how many power slots of each power level\na character can use at each character level.\nWhen a character casts a power, he or she expends a slot of that power's level or higher, effectively &quot;filling&quot; a slot\nwith the power. You can think of a power slot as a groove of a certain size - small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a\npower of higher level. A 1st-level power fits into a slot of any size, but a 4th-level power fits only in a 4th-level slot.\nSo when an adept casts lance, a 1st-level power, he or she spends one 1st-level slot.\nFinishing a long rest restores any expended power slots.\nCasting at a Higher Level\nWhen a powercaster casts a power using a slot that is of a higher level than the power, the power assumes the higher level\nfor that casting. For instance, if an operative casts lance using one of their 2nd-level slots, that lance is 2nd level.\nEffectively, the power expands to fill the slot it is put into.\nSome powers, such as lance and first ait, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a\npower's description.\nTech Points new\nIn Mass Effect 5e, certain classes can use tech points to cast powers. Tech points represent the internal power of\nthe operative's omni-tool. As the operative levels, the gain more tech points, representing the time they spend\nmodifying their omni-tool and optimizing subroutines.\nWhen a character casts a power with tech points, he or she expends, at minimum, one tech point per power's level:\n1 tech point for 1st-level, 2 tech points for 2nd level, etc. You can think of a tech point as a 1st-level power slot that\ncan be added to other tech points to create a power slot of a higher level. The number of tech points you can spend\non a power is limited by your class's level, indicated in the class's progression table.\nFinishing a long rest restores any expended tech points.\n",

The rules\nin this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places.\nFalling\nA fall from a great height is a common hazard, especially since many urban environments reach the skies. At the end of a\nfall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every  it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature\nlands prone unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.\nSuffocating\nA creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).\nWhen a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier\n(minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can't regain hit\npoints or be stabilized until it can breathe again.\nFor example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2\nrounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.\nSpace new\nThe vacuum of space will kill any organic (and most synthorganic creatures) in a matter of minutes unless that creature\nhas some specific resilience to surviving in a vacuum. A creature in the vacuum of space without an appropriate environmental\nsuit will remain conscious for a number of rounds equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum 1). After that time passes,\nthe creature immediate becomes incapacitated and it can survive in space a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution\nmodifier (minimum 1) after which it dies.\nVision and Light\nThe most fundamental tasks of adventuring - noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and\ntargeting a biotic power, to name just a few - rely heavily on a character's ability to see. Darkness and other effects\nthat obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.\nA given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog,\nor moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\nA heavily obscured area - such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage - blocks vision entirely. A creature\neffectively suffers from the blinded condition when trying to see something in that area.\nThe presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light,\nand darkness.\nBright light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do flashlights, fires, and\nother sources of illumination within a specific radius.\nDim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between\na source of bright light, such as a flashlight, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts\nas dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon (or moons) might bathe the surface of a planet in dim light.\nDarkness creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night, within the confines of a derelict\nstarship, or a subterranean ruin.\nBlindsight\nA creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures\nwithout eyes, such as thresher maws, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and yaghs, have\nthis sense.\nDarkvision\nSome creatures have darkvision and some gear can provide darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision\ncan see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that\ncreature is concerned. However, the creature can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\nTruesight change\nA creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal darkness, see invisible creatures and objects that\nare hidden by technological means (such as tactical cloak).\nInfrared vision new\nA creature with infrared vision, out to a specific range, can see in darkness, is unaffected by lightly or heavily obscured\nareas, and see invisible and hidden creatures and objects that give off heat.\nHowever, the creature cannot see beyond intense heat sources and is effectively blind when looking at an intense heat source.\nFood and Water\nCharacters who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion. Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can't be\nremoved until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.\nFood\nA character needs about 500 grams (~ 1lb) of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations.\nEating 250 grams of food in a day counts as half a day without food.\nA character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the\nend of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion. A normal day of eating\nresets the count of days without food to zero.\nWater\nA character needs 2 liters (~ 1/2 gallon) of water per day, or 4 liters per day if the weather is hot. A character who\ndrinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at\nthe end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end\nof the day.\nIf the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.\nInteracting with Objects\nA character's interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM\nthat his or her character is doing something, such as interacting with a terminal, and the GM describes what, if anything,\nhappens.\nFor example, a character might decide to interact with a terminal, which might, in turn, open a door, raise an alarm, or\ngive the character access to a map of the building. If the terminal is protected via security, though, a character might need\nto hack it. In such a situation, the GM might call for an Intelligence (Electronics) check to see whether the character can\nbypass the security. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.\nCharacters can also damage objects with their weapons, biotics, and tech. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage,\nbut otherwise, they can be affected by physical attacks much as creatures can. The GM determines an object's Armor Class\nand hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks.\n(It's hard to cut a cable with a hammer, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and\nthey are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.\nA character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.\n\n",

    "body": "A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of bullets, energy weapons, ducking behind cover,\nslinging biotic and tech powers. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round\nrepresents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of\nturns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a\nturn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.\nCombat Step by Step\n\nDetermine surprise. The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.\nEstablish positions. The GM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the operatives' marching\norder or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries ar - -how far away and in what direction.\nRoll initiative. Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants' turns.\nTake turns. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.\nBegin the next round. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.\n\nSurprise\nA team of operatives sneaks up on a patrolling cerberus squad, springing from behind cargo crates to attack them. A varren\nslinks in the shadows, unnoticed by the operatives until the varren attacks one of them. In these situations, one side of\nthe battle gains surprise over the other.\nThe GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other.\nOtherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of\neach creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn't notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.\nIf you're surprised, you can't move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can't take a reaction\nuntil that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren't.\nInitiative\nInitiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to\ndetermine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each\nmember of the group acts at the same time.\nThe GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This\nis the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same\nfrom round to round.\nIf a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among\ntheir tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally,\nthe GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.\nYour Turn\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take\nyour action first. Your speed - sometimes called your walking speed - is noted on your character sheet.\nThe most common actions you can take are described in the &quot;Actions in Combat&quot; section below. Many class features and\nother abilities provide additional options for your action.\nThe &quot;Movement and Position&quot; section gives the rules for your move.\nYou can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can't decide what to do on your\nturn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in &quot;Actions in Combat.&quot;\nBonus Actions\nVarious class features, powers, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action.\nThe Cunning Action feature, for example, allows an infiltrator to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only\nwhen a special ability, power, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You\notherwise don't have a bonus action to take.\nYou can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than\none available.\nYou choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action's timing is specified, and anything\nthat deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.\nOther Activity on Your Turn\nYour turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.\nYou can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.\nYou can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action.\nFor example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part\nof the same action you use to attack.\nIf you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some items and other special objects always\nrequire an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.\nThe GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an\nunusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a\npush a large crate into a covering position.\nReactions\nCertain special abilities, powers, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an\ninstant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else's. The opportunity attack,\ndescribed later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.\nWhen you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts\nanother creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.\n\n",

As such, detachable heat sinks, known as thermal clips, were adopted first by the geth,\nand shortly thereafter by organic arms manufacturers. Ammunition may never be a concern with modern arms, but the\navailability of thermal clips is; weapons without thermal clips have nowhere to disperse their heat and are incapable of\nfiring. Luckily, thermal clips litter modern battlefields and can be obtained from fallen enemies or found around the\nenvironment.\nUsing Thermal Clips\nWhen you reload your weapon, you expend a thermal clip.\nArmor Capacity: 10\nAll armor comes standard with 10 thermal clip slots. Some armor and mods allow you to increase this amount.\nResupplying: ~100 credits\nThermal clips are easily looted from almost every enemy wielding a weapon. However, you can also resupply all of your\nthermal clips at a gun shop or military depot for about 100 credits.\nNote: Because thermal clips are so easily attainable, GMs might find it more manageable to simply not keep track of\nthermal clips and assume players will always have a steady supply available to them.\nVariant: Venting\nInstead of thermal clips, each weapon's heat indicates the number of times it can be fired before it overheats. Replace\nany reference to Reloading with Venting. Venting works exactly the same as reloading, taking some amount of time to vent\nthe weapons heat (instead of reloading a thermal clip).\nIf a weapon is not fired for a full round of combat, it naturally regains 1 heat. Additionally, any weapon that is at 0\nheat can be fired, but it automatically jams and cannot be used until after a long rest.\n",

    "body": "A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or hack\na security system. Your species, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a\ntool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to\na single ability since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use.\nTool Proficiency change\nMass Effect 5e utilizes the Tool Proficiency rules found in Xanathar's Guide to Everything (pg. 78). In summary, it's\nunclear when a player should use a tool proficiency and a skill proficiency. The rule of thumb is that tools have\nspecific applications whereas skills are very broad, but this limits the use of tools.\nThus, to make tool proficiencies more attractive, Xanathar's Guide to Everything added benefits to combining tools with\nskills. The first is that combining a tool with a skill gives the player advantage when making the skill check.\nThe second benefit is that tools provide additional non-combat features.\nAdvantage or Added Benefit. When the character combines their tool proficiency with a skill, they gain additional insight\nwhich means the operative either gains advantage on the skill check or they can gain an added benefit, decided by the GM.\nFor example, a character that is proficient with Hacking Tools gains advantage when combining their tool proficiency\nwith an Intelligence (Investigation) check when utilizing networked systems (like the exonet) or they might gain\nan added benefit, such as finding some additional information or key codes.\nUnique Skill. Operatives proficient in a tool have a unique activity they can perform during a short or long rest.\nFor example, a character proficient with Armorsmith's Workbench can craft armor or attempt to remove mods.\nSample Activities. Each tool also has sample activity DCs. These are examples and not an exhaustive list. GMs can adjust\nDCs or create new activities as they see fit. These activities require a skill check, but the skill used is up to the GM.\nFor example, an operative proficient with hacking tools can disable a security system. This would likely require an\nIntelligence (Electronics) check, but if the security system required splicing wires, it might require a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)\ncheck instead.\nSee Appendix &gt; Tool Proficiencies\n\n",

    "body": "\nMass Effect Galaxy Map by otvert (Full Size)\nThe Milky Way\nThe Milky Way comprises a number of Clusters (represented by the yellow, target icons filter_center_focus on the map).\nEach Cluster is composed of Systems, and, in turn, each System contains a group of planetary objects (generally a\nstar and any number of planets and their moons, planetoids, asteroids, comets and other celestial bodies).\nFor example, Earth is a planet in the Sol System, which is the only system in the Local Cluster. Tuchanka (the homeworld\nof the Krogan) is part of the Aralakh System, which is one of 3 systems in the Krogan DMZ cluster.\nNote on names: You may wonder why the names aren’t more “alien”. Our best guess is that the names are either part\nof a human-centered database (in which names were provided to the entries by humans), or that the names have been\ntranslated into similar human-cultured counterparts. For example, the Athena Nebula is home of the Asari, a species of\nandrogynous beings that associate themselves to a female gender. Thus the nebula’s name (in Asari) might be a cultural\nfigure, turn-of-phase, or mystical entity that is best represented as Athena in human culture.\nTraveling between clusters, systems, and planets\nSpace Transports\nThere four types of transports in the game: land, water, air, and space. To leave a planet or move between planets in a\nsystem requires a space transport. For simplicity's sake, travel within a system (from any celestial body to\nanother) takes less than 24 hours. Using the Sol system as an example, a party could leave Earth and arrive at Io,\nEuropa, Pluto, or Sol’s Mass Relay within 24 hours. The GM can adjust this time as they see fit. A rickety ship\nmight move more slowly and require many stops at moons and planets along the way. A very fast ship might make the\njourney from Earth to Pluto within a few hours.\nLeaving a planet\nThe time it takes to leave a planet varies widely based on how regulated space traffic is on that planet. On urban worlds\nlike Thessia or the Citadel, it can take as long as 2-4 hours to orbit and dock. On uninhabited worlds, your ship can\nland and leave as quickly as the pilot is capable. This can take as little as a few minutes. Finding a safe place to\nland might take a little longer.\nStarships\nTo travel from system to system, or cluster to cluster, your party will need to use a starship. Every\nstarship has a range attribute which represents the number of system and cluster jumps it can make in a 24\nhour period. Traveling between systems in a cluster or jumping from one cluster to another takes 1 range.\nTraveling between systems is the same as traveling between planets. You can move to any other system within a cluster\nand it costs 1 range. A starship with 3 range that starts on Tuchanka can leave the planet an arrive in\nNith (another system in the Krogan DMZ cluster) within 24 hours. The same starship (with a range of 3) could also leave\nTurchanka, fly to the Nith system, then to the Dranek system (also in the Krogan DMZ cluster), and back to the\nAralakh system within a 24 hour period. If the ship was making stops on planets in each system, it would likely take\nlonger as the ship enters and leaves orbit.\nTraveling between clusters requires a Mass Relay. Mass Relays are mass transit devices scattered throughout the\nMilky Way, forming an enormous network that allows interstellar travel. There is only one Mass Relay per cluster, located\nin a single system which is marked with a * on the map. To travel from cluster to cluster, you must first travel to\nthe system that contains the mass effect relay. Then you can jump to another cluster.\nMass Relays are connected as a network, but travel between relays might require additional jumps. I.e., unlike travel\nbetween planets and systems, you can only move between clusters following the lines on the map.\nEXAMPLE TRAVEL\nThe party has been searching for a Prothean device in the Carbonaceous Asteroid (Phoenix system, Argos Rho cluster).\nTo collect their reward, they must return the device to a fence on the Citadel.\nIn this example, the party has requisitioned a starship with a range of 2. It takes 1 range to move from the\nPhoenix system to the Hydra system which contains the Mass Relay for the Argos Rho cluster. Then it requires 2 Mass\nRelay jumps (Argos Rho &gt; Horse Head Nebula &gt; Serpent Nebula), arriving in the Widow system where the Citadel is located.\nFor our group, this would take as little as 24 but no more than 48 hours to complete the journey.\n",

However, the rule of thumb is that the\naction taken is more Paragon-like or more Renegade-like than what an average sentient being would do.\nParagon vs Renegade\nWhat constitutes Paragon and what constitutes Renegade is a bit fuzzy.

    "body": "Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to\nuse. Whether you favor an assault rifle or a sword, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the\ndifference between life and death while on a mission.\nThe Weapons List shows the available weapons, their price and weight, the damage\nthey deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged.\nA melee weapon is used to attack a target within  of you, whereas a ranged weapon is used to attack a target at\na distance.\nWeapon Proficiency change\nYou must be proficient with a weapon type to add your proficiency modifier to the attack roll. There are 7 distinct weapon\ntypes and all weapons fall into one of the following types.\n\nAssault Rifles. The most common weapons of the military. These are generally medium-range weapons that deal average damage with a high heat capacity.\nHeavy Pistols. The most common gun type in the Mass Effect universe. Simple but effective.\nSub-machine Guns (SMGs). Single-handed, rapid fire weapons that have a short range.\nShotguns. Close-range, high-damage blasts.\nSniper Rifles. Precision instruments meant for long range or stealthy combat.\nMelee. Used in close-quarters combat. Damage resulting from melee weapon attacks by-pass shields.\nHeavy Weapons. Specialty weapons that deal massive amounts of damage. Heavy Weapons do not have a proficiency requirement.\n\nWeapon Properties\nMany weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons List.\nSee: Appendix &gt; Weapon Properties\nImprovised Weapons\nSometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes\nany object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a crowbar, or the arm of a geth.\nOften, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to\na club (melee weapon). At the GM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were\nthat weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.\nAn object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object).\nIf a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property,\nit also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of  and a long range of .\nLight improvised thrown weapons have ranges of  and , and heavy\nimprovised ranged weapons have ranges of  and .\nThermal Clips new\nRanged weapons (guns) use thermal clips to abate heat. All thermal clips are interchangeable between weapons. More information\nabout using thermal clips can be found below.\nHeavy Weapons new\nHeavy Weapons use Charges to track the number of times they can be fired. If you run out of Charges your weapon is nothing more than a hunk of metal.\nTargeting\nMost Heavy Weapons also use the Targeting condition. Targeting means painting the battlefield or keeping a lock on one\nor more creatures for a single round of combat. More information about targeting can be found in conditions appendix.\nCarrying, Holstering, and Drawing Weapons new\nYou have 4 weapon slots unless a feature or armor mod allows you to have more. Two-handed weapons take up 2 slots.\nIf using the Variant: Encumbrance rule, you can carry as many weapons as your carry capacity will allow.\nYou can holster one weapon you're wielding or draw one weapon you're carrying as a free action. This is true for all weapon types.\nHowever, to holster one weapon then draw a second weapon would require an action.\nBut the GM might allow a Sleight of Hand check to see if you can holster and draw at the cost of your bonus action.\n\n",

    "body": "Asari are a species of elegant, mono-gendered humanoids. The asari resemble female humans with blue or purple skin and a\ncrest of rigid tentacles in place of hair. Despite their feminine appearance, asari have little use for gender or\ngender roles, though they often use female pronouns and gendered language. They possess a unique method of reproduction\ninitiated by a &quot;mind meld&quot; which links the asari's nervous system with a partner-even one of a different species-to\nrandomize genes to create asari offspring. Asari have an innate biotic ability and don't require a biotic implant to\nmanipulate mass effect fields.\nUnmatched Patience\nBecause of their long lifespan, asari tend to have a &quot;long view&quot; not common in other species. When they encounter a new\nspecies or situation, the asari are more comfortable with an extended period of passive observation and study than immediate action.\nThey invite new species of advanced development to join the galactic community, knowing that their ideals and beliefs will\ninevitably influence the existing culture.\nMothers of the Galaxy\nAsari reproduction is very different from other forms of sexual reproduction. When a meld for reproduction is initiated, the\nasari accesses her partner's genes and subconsciously uses them as an algorithmic seed to remap genes into a unique set of DNA.\nThe offspring resulting from such interspecies pairings are always asari as no DNA is taken from the partner. Instead,\nthe asari uses the meld to explore her partner's genetic heritage and pass desirable traits on to any offspring and\nas a &quot;map&quot; to randomize the genes of the offspring.\nAsari believe that their offspring acquire the best qualities of the &quot;father&quot; from the melded genes. Therefore, they frown\nupon intraspecies conception, since genetic traits and cultural insight is gained from mating outside their species, so\nit's considered wasteful for asari to reproduce together. The results of such unions are occasionally referred to as\n&quot;purebloods&quot;, a great insult among contemporary asari. A rare genetic defect known as Ardat-Yakshi, which makes\nasari destroy the partner's mind during melding, occurs much more frequently among the daughters of purebloods.\nMaiden, Matron, Matriarch\nAsari pass through three climacteric life stages, marked by biochemical and physiological changes. The Maiden stage\nbegins at puberty and is marked by the drive to explore and experience. Most young asari are curious and restless, and\nit is not uncommon for many to try their hand at dancing in bars or working as mercenaries during this time. The Matron\nstage of life begins around the age of 350, though it can be triggered earlier if the individual melds frequently. This\nperiod is marked by a desire to settle in one area and raise children. The Matriarch stage begins around 700 years\nof age, or earlier if the individual melds rarely. Matriarchs become active in their community as sages and councilors,\ndispensing wisdom from centuries of experience. Their knowledge and guidance may be one reason why Matriarchs are rarely seen outside asari space.\nHowever, each stage can be started whenever an asari feels that she has reached the correct level of maturity.\nAsari Names\nAsari are given a personal name by their parents and take the surname of their mothers, even if the child has 2 asari\nparents. Outside of asari communities, they normally do not use their surnames and prefer to introduce themselves with\ntheir personal name only. Matriarchs are addressed as &quot;Matriarch&quot; but other titles may be used for matriarchs in prestigious positions.\nPersonal Names: Aeian, Aethyta, Aleena, Alestia, Aria, Batha, Benezia, Dahlia, Falere, Irissa, Jona, Liara, Lidanya,\nLiselle, Mallene, Morinth, Nassana, Nyxeris, Pelessaria, Rana, Rila, Samara, Sarissa, Shiala, Tela, Tevos, Treeya\nSurnames: Ateyne, B'Sayle, Calis, D'Layne, D'Nava, D'Ysesan, Dantius, Iallis, Iasava, Janieri, Kelis, M'Loari, M'Taros,\nMakenus, Nuwani, Sedela, Sederis, T'Goni, T'Loak, T'Soni, Thanoptis, Theris, V'Lanis, V'Nato, V'Tizor, Vasir\n\n",

The memories are so strong that an external stimulus can trigger a powerful memory recall and\nthese recalls are so vivid and detailed that some drell may mistake it for reality.\nHomeworld Lost\nThe drell ancestors emerged from dry, rocky deserts on the barren world of Rakhana. Eight centuries ago, the already-arid\ndrell homeworld began its swift descent into lifelessness due to disastrous industrial expansion.

They see death as a\ndeparture from the body, and they also state that a person's body and soul form a Whole. When the soul is traumatized or\notherwise disrupted, or the body is ill or injured, a person is no longer Whole. They also believe that their body can be\ndirected as a separate entity from themselves, thus, some drell take no responsibility when executing an order given by\nthe hanar even if the order is an assassination.\nThe religion includes at least three gods which drell often pray to for guidance and protection:\n\nAmonkira, Lord of Hunters\nArashu, Goddess of Motherhood and Protection\nKalahira, Goddess of Oceans and Afterlife.\n\n\nDrell Names\nDrell use given and family names.\nMale Names: Chas, Drino, Hite, Hoskim, Lofo, Massa, Neta, Nitos, Ruyim, Tako, Tayu, Thane, Tumil, Yesit\nFemale Names: Ares, Arina, Ehanen, Ekire, Eshesnu, Inashe, Inukmel, Itheyl, Odrinne, Oshane, Ulanten, Uthoru\nFamily Names: Dreis, Feun, Futos, Keas, Krios, Kuun, Mout, Soas, Shuit, Suul, Thatos, Yeos\n\n",

As many geth were designed as tools of war, the quarians were quickly\nand easily defeated.

Unfortunately, as krogan society became more\ntechnologically advanced, so did their weaponry. The end result is that they destroyed their homeworld in a nuclear war\nthat reduced their species into primitive warring tribes.\nBiologically Impervious\nKrogan biology reflects the conditions from where they come. The krogan are armored nearly head to toe in thick, chitinous\nplates which protect the krogan from the hazards of their homeland. They possess a hump which can store water and nutrients,\nfor the resources in Tuchanka are scare.\nCuriously, the krogan also possess redundant organs; a second set of major organs in case of failure or injury. These\ntraits make krogan exceptionally difficult to kill, but perhaps what makes krogan so dangerous is an adaptation known as &quot;Blood Rage.&quot;\nBlood Rage\nThe blood rage is a legendary state of pure violence. When krogan enter a blood rage, they become nearly mindless\nkilling machines, fighting through all injury and even death. Blood rage is due to an enormous flood of adrenaline and\nsuppression of serotonin, which numbs the krogan to all pain. This state, combined with their plated hide, and redundant\norgans, allows the krogan to defeat creatures many times his size or power.\nClimb Atop the Dead\nKrogan's value one thing above all else: strength. Krogan society is built upon this hierarchy, where the strong rule\nand the weak perish. They live in clans lead by a Warlord, and those clans constantly war for resources and for power.\nEven within these clans, treachery and distrust run rampant. Krogan often fight for dominance within these clans and\nwill sacrifice their clan for personal gain without a second thought. Females are considered prizes and trophies and\nlive in clans separate from the males.\nRites and Rituals\nThe krogan culture is steeped in rituals. When a krogan is born, he suffers the Rite of Life. When wishes to join his\nfirst clan, he undergoes the Rite of Passage. If he wishes to be considered for breeding, he must take the Rite of Honor.\nWhen facing a new enemy, the Rite of Firsts is invoked.\nA Krogan clan also has a shaman, who has endured the Rite of Insight. The rituals endured by a shaman are lengthy and\ntorturous; most krogan who attempt the rite perish. Those who survive become the most respected member of their clan\nand are rarely challenged. The shaman is a clan's spiritual leader and guide and is believed to see into the spirit\nworld itself.\nKrogan Names\nKrogan names are fairly simple: a clan name followed by a given name, which is normally bestowed upon them by their father.\nMale Names: Archuk, Brood, Charr, Drax, Fortak, Grunt, Guld, Jarrod Nax, Okeer, Skarr, Strux, Uvenk, Wreav, Wrex\nFemale Names: Bakara, Chormi, Derge, Hazka, Jonde Kesh, Khorga, Kherake, Morda, Tegash, Vruxa, Zrogoga\nClan Names: Garbon, Gatatog, Jorgal, Khutarum, Nakmor, Srarkan, Traash, Urdnot, Verbok, Weryloc, Wudark\n\n",

    "body": "The Protheans are an ancient alien species which mysteriously vanished over 50,000 years ago. The Protheans arose from a\nsingle planet and developed an immense galaxy-wide empire encompassing many other spacefaring species. Not much is known\nabout them, but many of their artifacts, ruins and technology have apparently survived the ages.\nAncient Empire\nAfter achieving spaceflight, the Protheans discovered the ruins of a previous spacefaring species, the inusannon, and from\nthose ruins learned about mass effect physics and developed FTL technology. The Protheans would expand throughout the\ngalaxy with the help of the mass relay network and make the Citadel their capital.\nEarly in their development, the Protheans encountered a hostile machine intelligence which threatened to overwhelm them.\nTo defeat the machines, the Protheans decided to unite all of the galaxy's sentient organic life under their empire.\nThe other organic species were free to resist, but those that tried were crushed, and none ever managed to best the Protheans' might.\nReaper Invasion\nThe Protheans' belief that they could hold their own against machine intelligence was shattered with the arrival of the\nReapers in approximately 48,000 BCE, who were far more advanced than the machines the Protheans had been battling. They\nwere caught completely off-guard by the scale and rapidity of the assault. The Reapers entered the galaxy through the\nCitadel, instantly decapitating the Protheans' government and disrupting the mass relay network, isolating Prothean systems\nfrom one another. The Protheans' greatest strength, their unified empire, proved to be their downfall.\nStasis\nIn a desperate attempt to survive the Reaper invasion, the Protheans built massive, hidden stasis facilities that could\nhold hundreds of thousands of stasis pods. Some facilities were found by Reaper agents or betrayed by indoctrinated Protheans.\nUnfortunately, the facilities that remained hidden faced another challenge: a finite power source. The VI's left to control\nthese facilities began systematically cutting power to non-essential staff to conserve energy. 50,000 years later,\nthe number of active pods in each facility might be less than a dozen and without knowing the location of these hidden\nbunkers, its impossible to know how many protheans have survived.\nAll Eyes on You\nAs a prothean, you constantly attract the attention of other species. Your accent, mannerisms, figures of\nspeech, and appearance all mark you as more alien than most aliens. Curious glances are directed your\nway wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued\nby your ancient culture, to say nothing of everyday beings who are eager to hear stories of your origin.\nAvatars\nProtheans that ascended to places of prominence in their society were designated as avatars, or exemplars, of a particular\nvirtue of their culture. Example virtues include benevolence, cleanliness, courage, dignity, frugality, honor, justice,\nmercy, order, perseverance, temperance, tranquility, truthfulness, vengeance. As one of the last remaining Protheans,\nit is likely you are an avatar or, waking up to find you species all but extinct, you may self-appoint\nyour own virtue.\nProthean Names\nInterestingly, protheans name themselves, usually after an icon or mentor. Until they've chosen a name, they are\ncalled little one, child, or some other generic term.\nMale names: Arkath, Esrad, Caed, Dervan Had, Dencen, Hsed Mik, Javik, Jacen, Ksad Ishan, Lucen, Pashek Vran, Seset Amat, Tev Boken\nFemale names: Athi Let, Brene She, Balani, Calise, Cethi, Cosene, Eri Mase, Hulana, Haetha, Janiri, Kelthana, Laene Valte, Masani, Neona, Penta Tetha, Savisa\n\n",

    "body": "Forced out of their homeland by sapient constructs of their own creation, quarian are exiled nomads that now sail the\nseas in search of a new homeland.\nExotic Fashion\nIdentifying a quarian is easy. All quarians wear enviro-suits, which are multipurpose outfits that protect them from\nforeign pathogens and diseases as well as acting as spacesuits for scavenging or repair of shuttles. Rannoch's ecosystem\nfeatured symbiotic microorganisms that aren't found anywhere else in the galaxy. Thus, when the quarians were exiled, they\nwere also burdened to life in a suit.\nThe enviro-suits have moved beyond function, however, and into their culture. A quarian is rarely, if ever, seen\nwithout their suit and helmet, and when they return from their pilgrimage as adults, they are expected to modify their\nsuit to fit their personal reflection of their status as a productive member of the Flotilla.\nExiles of their Own Creations\nQuarians have a long and deep history with creating constructs known as &quot;Geth,&quot; meaning &quot;Servant of the People&quot;. These\nconstructs were built to serve and protect the quarians, and most quarian families had at least one servant, while the\nquarian military consisted of these autonomous beings.\nThe quarians sought to constantly improve their creation with more advanced virtual intelligence so they could complete increasingly\ncomplex tasks. These improvements lead to the geth's sapience and they began to question their masters. The quarians\nattempted to exterminate them, but after forming so much dependence on the geth, the quarians were swiftly defeated.\nWith many exterminated, the remaining quarians fled their homeland of Rannoch.\nCybernetic Improvements\nThough the quarians have abandoned their long history of construct and VI creation, they put their knowledge of engineering\nand technology into their own bodies to augment themselves. These augments are crafted by artisans who have descended\nfrom or studied under those who originally worked with or programmed the geth. The implants themselves are normally\nsmall, no larger than the size of a palm, and when properly inserted give the quarian enhanced ability compared to\nthose without. A quarian chooses an augment before they leave for the Pilgrimage, and the implantation of the device\nis part of their sending off ceremony.\nMigrant Fleet\nThe nomads travel together in a collective of ships known as the Flotilla or the Migrant Fleet and consists of those\nwho escaped death by the geth. The Flotilla contains over fifty thousand vessels collectively that travel the galaxy\nstrip-mining and harvesting resource to keep the fleet afloat. Some ships decide to depart the fleet to pursue their\nown goals but normally return to the fleet.\nWhen young quarian rejoin the flotilla after their pilgrimage, they are expected to join the crew of another vessel\nto ensure genetic diversity of an already small population.\nThe Pilgrimage\nDuring quarian adolescence, they are subjected to a rite of passage known as the pilgrimage. When young adulthood is\nreached, quarians are expected to leave the Migrant Fleet and experience life outside of their culture. To rejoin the\nflotilla, the young quarian must bear a gift to the captain of a new vessel. This gift can be tangible, such as\nresources, or intangible such as information. Most quarian operatives are those on their pilgrimage, though there are\nthose who decide never to return to the fleet or those who were rejected from rejoining.\nQuarian Names\nQuarian names are composed of three parts: the quarian's given name and family name separated by an apostrophe, and the\nname of their vessel preceeded by a title - &quot;nar&quot; to denote their birth ship and &quot;vas&quot; to denote their post-pilgrimage ship.\nFor example, nar Rayya or vas Neema.\nMale Names: Golo, Han, Hilo, Kal, Kar, Keenah, Kenn, Lemm, Les, Prazza, Rael, Seeto, Shio, Veetor, Ysin, Zaal, Zer\nFemale Names: Ceni, Daro, Elan, Feda, Jura, Laele, Lia, Meeri, Minn, Reen, Saesa, Shala, Shuni, Tali, Yosi, Zohe,\nFamily Names: Breizah, Dannah, Gazu, Gerral, Hodda, Jaa, Koris, Leth, Mal, Mekk, Nara, Raan, Reegar, Shaal, Shiya, Vael, Xen, Zorah\nVessel Names: Honorata, Idenna, Moreh, Neema, Novarra, Qwib Qwib, Rayya, Tesleya, Tonbay, Ulnay, Usela\n\n",

    "body": "Salarians are a warm-blooded amphibious species from a jungle known as Sur'Kesh. The salarian possess a\nsuper-charged metabolism which causes them to function at a much higher speed than other species while requiring less rest.\nAdditionally, they have an exceptional capability for observation, recollection, and innovation. They are constantly\ntinkering, experimenting, inventing, and researching and value intelligence and knowledge above all else.\nHyperactive Metabolism\nThe speed at which a salarian metabolizes is a marvel of evolution. The species only requires only one hour of sleep a\nnight, and still, they have more energy and alertness than other species. Everything a salarian does seems to be faster.\nThey talk fast, think fast, move fast, eat fast, and even sleep fast. The large amount of available energy has\nadvanced their intellectual capabilities. They need near constant stimulation for their fidgety, active bodies.\nBoredom, the Mother of Invention\nSalarians minds are constantly racing at miles per minute, and without proper mental stimulation, a salarian becomes bored.\nTinkering and experimenting are natural solutions to a restless mind. The ability to plow through ideas, situations,\nand possibilities makes them natural inventors. Salarians have perhaps some of the most advanced technology, especially\nin electronics and engineering, but a salarian can become an expert at whatever craft he puts his mind to.\nKnowledge is Power\nInvention is not the only outlet of a salarian's mind. As many as those who invent prefer to gather information and\nknowledge. Observation, research, study, and espionage are other areas at which salarians tend to excel. A\nphotographic memory with a high capacity for information makes salarians who dabble in information trading very\nskilled and valuable. Knowledge gained from a salarian is highly prized as nearly infallible, and so these\ntrades are viable life paths.\nOne Mother Among Sons\nSalarian reproduction is curious in that fertilized eggs hatch as females and unfertilized eggs hatch as male. According\nto ancient societal codes and law, fertilization of eggs is strictly regulated and thus 90% of the population is male.\nRomantic and sexual relationships are nearly nonexistent among salarian, and any sexuality is strictly for reproduction.\nAs females are so rare, they normally stay within salarian colonies where they possess positions of political\npower in a complex matriarchal government.\nMatriarchal Feudalism\nSalarians have a layered system of government, ultimately ruled by a matriarch known as a dalatrass, with her\ndaughters serving in noble positions beneath her. A noble family headed by the dalatrass controls a massive territory\nknown as a march that is further divided into duchies, baronies, and fiefdoms. Dalatrasses and their noble\nmatrilinear lines will make political alliances with other families through interbreeding. A salarian\nis loyal through a biological process known as imprinting to their parents and to their dalatrass, which keeps the feudal society stable.\nIntense Curiosity\nDespite imprinted loyalty to their family and dalatrass, male salarians are free to leave the colony at any time. Females,\nhowever, due to their noble blood and political power, almost always stay within the confines of salarian territories,\nthough some do venture out for other political positions such as ambassadors or emissaries. Salarian curiosity and\npursuit of knowledge often lead them past the jungles of Sur'Kesh, if even only for a brief time. Many find new\nlives far from Sur'Kesh, though they rarely truly abandon their family and dalatrass.\nSalarian Names\nSalarian names are quite complex. A full name includes - in order - the name of a salarian's march,\nduchy, barony, fiefdom, family, and finally, the given name. However, few salarians use their full name unless\nnecessary and prefer to go by their family and given name.\nExample Full Names: Rannadril Ghan Swa Fulsoom Karaten Narr Eadi Bel Anoleis, Gorot II Heranon Mal Dinest Got Inoste Ledra\nGiven Names: Beelo, Chorban, Esheel, Ish, Jarroth, Jarun, Jondum, Kallo, Kirrahe, Maelon, Mordin, Morlan, Padok, Palon, Rentola, Schells, Solik, Tazzik, Tolan, Valern, Zevin\nFamily Names: Aenarth, Aulaw, Bau, Erkoln, Faergow, Gurji, Heplorn, Inoste, Irheth, Jath, Jowar, Marhall, Raeka, Sernik, Solus, Tann, Vass, Venirn, Vodol, Wiks, Yosann\n\n",

    "body": "A highly militaristic species, turians are a force to be feared. These warriors are easily distinguished by an appearance\ncontaining a strange mix of insectoid and avian features. The turian army is substantial, and every member of the turian\nspecies is obligated to attend combat training in adolescence. Even citizens and artisans are foes to be reckoned with.\nDespite such an emphasis on combat, however, turians are an honorable and noble species.\nDiscipline and Honor\nThe entire turian culture revolves around a strict code of conduct which highly emphasizes strong discipline and personal\nresponsibility. Turians are highly inclined towards self-sacrifice and will put the good of society over their own\npersonal desires. As such, they are passionate about public and social service and make poor merchants and entrepreneurs.\nThey are taught to own their decisions, good or bad, and if confronted with accusations it is considered heinous to\nlie about their actions. Because of this, many species attribute to them a &quot;turian honor&quot; seen rarely outside the turian species.\nProud Warrior Species\nAt the center of turian society is their military. Turians are sent to basic training in their teenage years\nand are obligated to serve time in the military, if physically able. This develops respect for\nauthority as well as imparting control and restraint among the turians. Though some turians do not continue their\nservice in the armed forces, they continue to serve their community through other branches of the military which serve\nthe whole by providing public services.\nHierarchal Meritocracy\nTurian government is entwined with its military, as so many parts of society are. There are tiers of citizenship, with\nthe lowest being a regular citizen, often held by client species and children, climbing all the way up to the Primarchs\nwhich lead each turian colony. Lower ranking citizens are expected to obey and support superiors while higher ranking\nones are expected to lead and protect lower ranks. Promotion to a new tier is based on personal ability and merit and\nare given due to assessments from one's superiors.\nDespite the ranked structure, turians entertain many freedoms as long as they perform their duties and do not infringe\non others freedoms or responsibilities.\nReflective Carapace\nThe homeland of the turians, Palaven, has a high level of solar radiation. Turians have evolved semi-metallic\ncarapaces that reflect the dangerous radiation, protecting their inners from the solar rays. These exoskeletons, however,\ndo not protect the turian from physical damage such as wounds and do not provide any natural armor.\nMission or Desertion\nMost Turians who leave Palaven or another colony do so by order of their superiors to accomplish special missions.\nSome, however, abandon the society for various reasons, most commonly a desire for freedom from the unyielding law and command.\nThose who desert their military post or other assigned position are exiled from Palaven, as this is seen as the ultimate betrayal.\nTurian Names\nTurians are given personal names by their parents and take on a family name. High-ranking turian officers also include\ntheir title in their names, either in addition to their full names or as a replacement of their personal name.\nSometimes turians go by their family name only.\nMale Names: Adrien, Avitas, Castis, Chellick, Corinthus, Desolas, Garrus, Illo, Jacobus, Joram, Kuril, Lantar, Lilihierax, Lorik, Macen, Mehrkuri, Nihlus, Quentius, Sapartus, Saren, Septimus, Tarquin, Tiran, Tonn, Venari,\nFemale Names: Abrudas, Aciia, Aemicida, Alta, Banrae, Caevea, Cicean, Duronea, Iciria, Juteia, Nyreen, Orinia, Pliras, Quidas, Selone, Sidera, Sipia, Valevas, Vetra\nFamily Names: Actus, Arterius, Barro, Kandros, Kryik, Nazario, Nyx, Oraka, Pallin, Qui'in, Rix, Sidonis, Talid, Vakarian, Victus, Vyrnnus\n\n",

They\nhail from Irune, which possesses a high-pressure greenhouse atmosphere able to support ammonia-based biochemistry.\nMysterious Biology\nThe volus are unable to survive unprotected in an atmosphere more suitable to humans and other carbon-based lifeforms,\nand as such require pressurized, protective suits capable of providing the proper atmosphere. Traditional nitrogen/oxygen\nair mixtures are poisonous to them, and in the low pressure atmospheres tolerable to most species, their flesh will actually\nsplit open.Unlike quarians, who can withstand brief periods outside their suit, volus choose never to take theirs off,\nespecially in the presence of other species. Therefore, little is known about their physiology. Despite individuals distinctly\nsounding like males or females to human listeners, volus genders are a mystery as well. The volus themselves consider\nthe question both intrusive and hilariously irrelevant.\nTrade Warriors\nThe volus homeworld Irune is remarkable for having done away with warfare as an institution of the state. Instead,\nvolus romanticize a good bargain, haggling, and creative accounting. The fervent pursuit of economic wealth has\nmade volus a species of aggressive traders and industrialists with a keen grasp of exchange and finance.\nMany of the galaxy's largest banks, holding corporations, and manufacturing cartels, such as the\nElkoss Combine, are owned or managed by volus. They also regulate the Citadel's complex galactic economy and were\nresponsible for the Unified Banking Act, which established the &quot;credit&quot; as the standard currency of interstellar\ntrade.\nUnlike most other species, volus are more comfortable with delayed gratification, especially when it comes to spending\ntheir credits. Fugacious and materialistic purchases are rarely made. Instead, volus like to invest or save their money,\nsometimes to a fault. In fact, the volus economy is largely bolstered by the large estates of wealthy volus who never\nspent a cred.\nCouncil Seat\nDespite their important contributions to the Citadel and galactic society, they have never been offered a seat on the\nCouncil. This is a source of anger for some volus, particularly the volus ambassador Din Korlack. Council species need\nto have provided some extraordinary service to the Citadel, such as the turians' military support during the\nKrogan Rebellions. Council species also need to provide fleets, resources, and economic aid in case of disaster,\nnone of which the volus can currently supply. Therefore, the latest investment pursued by the volus is the construction\nof well-armed dreadnoughts.\nVolus Names\nVolus have two names but no family names.

Even as their population grows, the vorcha constantly fight each other in fierce competition over basic\nnecessities.
