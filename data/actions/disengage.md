If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity
attacks for the rest of the turn.

__Shield Regen__. If you take the Disengage action and take no damage until the start of your next turn,
your shields begin to regenerate and you gain shield points equal to your armor's regen.
You continue to gain shield points equal to your regen stat at the start of each of your turns.
If you take damage or you reach your maximum shield point capacity, the regeneration ends.
