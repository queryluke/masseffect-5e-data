name: Dodge
type: action
---
When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next
turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you
make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or
if your speed drops to 0.

__Shield Regen__. If you take the Dodge action and take no damage until the start of your next turn,
your shields begin to regenerate and you gain shield points equal to your armor's regen.
You continue to gain shield points equal to your regen stat at the start of each of your turns.
If you take damage or you reach your maximum shield point capacity, the regeneration ends.
