name: Grapple
type: action
---
When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special
melee attack, a grapple. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this
attack replaces one of them.

The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your
reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead
of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics)
or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed,
you subject the target to the <me-condition id="grappled" /> condition. The condition
specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like
(no action required).

__Escaping a Grapple__. A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must
succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength
(Athletics) check.

__Moving a Grappled Creature__. When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature
with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.
