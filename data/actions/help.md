name: Help
type: action

When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check
it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the
start of your next turn.

Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within <me-distance length="5" />
of you. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with
advantage.
