When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide,
following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in
[Making an Attack > Unseen Attackers and Targets](/manual/combat#making-an-attack).

__Shield Regen__. If you take the Disengage action and take no damage until the start of your next turn,
your shields begin to regenerate and you gain shield points equal to your armor's regen.
You continue to gain shield points equal to your regen stat at the start of each of your turns.
If you take damage or you reach your maximum shield point capacity, the regeneration ends.
