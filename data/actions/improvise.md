name: Improvise
type: action
---
Your character can do things not covered by the actions in list here, such as hacking,
intimidating enemies, sensing weaknesses in technological, or calling for a cease fire.
The only limits to the actions you can attempt are your imagination and your character's
ability scores.

When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether
that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any,
to determine success or failure.
