Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To
do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the
start of your next turn.

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the
action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in
response to it. Examples include "If the husk steps on the descends the dragon's tooth,
I'll throw a grenade at it," and "If the banshee teleports steps next to me, I cast Nova."

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or
ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.

When you ready a power, you cast it as normal but hold off on the final physical mnenomics or
omni-tool process, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be
readied, a power must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the power
requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the power dissipates without taking effect.
