Most ranged weapons have a heat property which indicates the number of times it can be fired before the thermal clip
must be exchanged. When you take the Reload Action, you expend a Thermal Clip from your inventory and insert it into
the weapon you're currently holding, returning the weapon's heat to its maximum value.
