You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a weapon as
part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object
action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object
on your turn.

Common examples of using an object include:

- Throwing a grenade
- Firing a Heavy Weapon
- Using Medi-gel
