  This special-issue Andromeda Initiative helmet is custom designed for
  explorers who excel in the Initiative training programs taken on prior to
  departing for Andromeda. Its Pathfinder-grade construction is strong enough to
  protect the wearer from the dangers of unexplored space while remaining light
  enough to allow full mobility.
