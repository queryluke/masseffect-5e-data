  Originally created for Earth's Urban Combat Championship league, this set of
  armor has undergone as much or more field testing than those of modern
  militaries. It uses a unique, proprietary power cell that costs as much as a
  EUCC rookie's contract. The armor's microframe computer adapts to any top-tier
  omni-tool, kinetic barrier, or biotic amp, giving breathtaking and error-free
  performance.
