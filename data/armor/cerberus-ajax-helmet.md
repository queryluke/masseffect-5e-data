  Among Cerberus soldiers, Ajax armor is favored by those brave or unlucky
  enough to lead charges to break enemy formations. Its role is to keep the
  wearer standing and shooting as long as possible. It offers some benefit to
  omni-tool and biotic amp systems, but its main emphasis is boosting and
  recharging its kinetic barrier and bleeding off weapon heat through coolant
  circulation in its gloves.
