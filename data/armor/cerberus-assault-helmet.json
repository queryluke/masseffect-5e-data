  "description": "Cerberus assault armor is designed for shock troops, who are expected to turn the tide of battle against creatures or forces that would decimate normal soldiers. The troops demanded three things in its design: shields and armor thick enough to last against a superior foe, and compartments for extra thermal clips. The only drawback of the armor is its weight, which the troops carry as a point of pride. They have a saying: \"Out of shape going in, in shape coming out.\"",
