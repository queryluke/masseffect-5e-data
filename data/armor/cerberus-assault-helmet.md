  Cerberus assault armor is designed for shock troops, who are expected to turn
  the tide of battle against creatures or forces that would decimate normal
  soldiers. The troops demanded three things in its design: shields and armor
  thick enough to last against a superior foe, and compartments for extra
  thermal clips. The only drawback of the armor is its weight, which the troops
  carry as a point of pride. They have a saying: "Out of shape going in, in
  shape coming out."
