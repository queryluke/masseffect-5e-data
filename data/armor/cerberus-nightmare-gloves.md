  Nightmare armor is worn by Cerberus Phantoms expecting long-range conflicts.
  Powerful capacitors deliver punishing energy to the Phantom's weapons, and
  circulating coolant in its gloves allows for more shots before a given thermal
  clip overheats. The remaining energy focuses on shield strength and
  regeneration time to help survivability.
