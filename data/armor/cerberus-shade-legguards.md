  Cerberus Shade armor is worn by Phantoms who need to be prepared for a wide
  variety of threats. Its capacitors give modest boosts to shields and shield
  regeneration time. Many small improvements increase the performance of biotic
  amps and omni-tools, heat management and kinetic coils for ranged weapons, and
  synthetic muscle assistors for melee capability.
