  "description": "Spirit armor is worn by Cerberus Phantoms fortunate enough to be biotic or for those who are skilled enough to use highly technical attacks. The armor has small gains for shield strength and regeneration, but where it truly shines is in its capacity to amplify biotic amps and omni-tools. These attacks hit significantly harder and more often, allowing the Phantom to dismantle heavily-armored targets.",
