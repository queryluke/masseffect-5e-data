  Spirit armor is worn by Cerberus Phantoms fortunate enough to be biotic or for
  those who are skilled enough to use highly technical attacks. The armor has
  small gains for shield strength and regeneration, but where it truly shines is
  in its capacity to amplify biotic amps and omni-tools. These attacks hit
  significantly harder and more often, allowing the Phantom to dismantle
  heavily-armored targets.
