  The Collectors' chitinous armor is flexible and even tougher than ballistic
  fibers. Its organic construction allows it to be self-healing, and the
  muscle-like tissue that assists movement ensures it is comfortable to wear
  despite its weight. This suit was originally adapted out of salvaged Collector
  technology by Cerberus and is incredibly difficult to find on the galactic
  market.
