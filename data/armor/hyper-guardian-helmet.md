  HyperGuardian hardsuits were built by Kassa Fabrication as a civilian-friendly
  alternative to the Colossus line intended for private security in heavy-fire
  situations or extreme environmental conditions. The Initiative considered the
  bulky and unbreakable HyperGuardian a perfect choice for protecting vulnerable
  new colonies.
