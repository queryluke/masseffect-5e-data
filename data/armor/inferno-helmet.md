  Built specifically for Cerberus field officers, the Inferno armor has a VI
  dedicated to recognizing signs of stress and medical trauma. This application
  helps assess soldiers but can be useful in any high-risk situations. The
  Inferno's microframe computer also manages biotic amp and omni-tool power, and
  microservos help the wearer's movements to counteract the armor's weight.
