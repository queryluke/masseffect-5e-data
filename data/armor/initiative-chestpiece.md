  Standard-issue Andromeda Initiative hardsuits are designed for exploration as
  much as combat, combining jump-jets, high-grade external and internal sensors,
  and a variety of atmospheric filters with the usual kinetic barrier generators
  and ceramic armor plating. Personnel equipped in these suits can enter and
  leave alien biomes without fear of contamination or hostile wildlife.
