  Standard-issue Andromeda Initiative hardsuits are designed for exploration as
  much as combat, combining jump-jets, high-grade external and internal sensors,
  and a variety of atmospheric filters with the usual kinetic barrier generators
  and ceramic armor plating. Personnel equipped in these suits can enter and
  leave alien biomes without fear of contamination or hostile wildlife.

- Your jump distance is tripled. If you jump straight up, you can hover at the apex of your jump
until the start of your next turn, at which point, you fall slowly back to the ground, taking half
of your movement speed for this turn.
