  The Reckoner-Knight armor was originally worn by the winners of Earth's Urban
  Combat Championship 2186, the Rhode Island Knights. A military-grade version
  of this equipment was presented to longtime Knight fans at the Alliance's
  Rhode Island base, in thanks for their passionate (and vocal) support during
  the EUCC championship matches. Beneath this armor's medieval-gothic facade lie
  a host of biofeedback systems intended to monitor the wearer's health and
  combat performance. Micro-servos maximize damage done in close-quarters
  combat, while a beefed-up power cell feeds energy into weapons systems to
  increase projectile velocity. Befitting gear originally designed for a
  full-contact sport, a sophisticated shield system also offers the wearer solid
  protection from incoming attacks.
