  This armor was designed from scratch by the Initiative using Remnant
  technology. Its servos, microframe computer, and kinetic barrier generators
  are all dependent on Remnant science and artifacts. This resilient and
  regenerative hardsuit has an energy surplus, though its internal systems can
  be difficult to properly monitor.
