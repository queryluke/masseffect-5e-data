  The Terminus Armor is environmentally sealed with an independent air supply
  for use in space and extreme planetary conditions. Its onboard microframe
  computer runs a suite of battle management software. To prevent detection by
  passive thermal sensors, body heat is channeled to the base of the feet and
  dispersed into the ground.
