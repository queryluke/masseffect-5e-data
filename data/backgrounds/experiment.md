__Skill Proficiencies__. Science and Survival.

__Tool Proficiencies__. Tinker's Tools and your choice of Medical Kit, Disguise Kit, or Chemist's Supplies.

__Equipment__. A set of common clothes, a trinket from your program of origin, Tinker's Tools, and 300 credits.

### Choose one of the following features

__Feature: What Doesn't Kill You__. You were the subject of experimentation in your youth, with the goal of stripping
away the old you and turning you into a weapon. The program could have been funded by your race's government, a
shadow organization, or a single mad scientist who kidnapped you. It could have had the goal of turning you into the
ultimate soldier, perhaps an unrivaled biotic, or even a genius tech engineer.

Regardless of the program's nature or success, you survived your difficult trials and came out tougher for it. You've
been pushed to the edge of death before, so it doesn't scare you. Once per long rest, you can choose to make a death
saving throw with advantage due to your strong drive to survive.

### Suggested Characteristics
Experiments are all maladjusted to society, but not all experiments are unable to adapt. Most experiments prefer to be loners
and come off as aloof or emotionless. Over time, with a close-knit group, some experiments tend to open up and show a softer side.
