You attempt to compel a sentient creature (Intelligence of 4 or more) that you can see and that can hear you.
It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the next hour. If you or creatures that are friendly
to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.

While the creature is charmed, you can issue commands to it while you are conscious (no action required), which it
does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature,"
"Run over there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction
from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds,
the spell ends.

You may use this benefit once per long rest.
