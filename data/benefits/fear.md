You attempt to frighten a sentient creature (Intelligence 4 or more) that can see or hear you. It must succeed on a
Wisdom saving throw or it becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. The creature may use its action to make another
Wisdom saving throw on each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer frightened of you.

You may use this benefit once per long rest.
