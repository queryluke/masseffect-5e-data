I was hesitant to bump the version because only two things have changed. But...

### Spells
__Throw__: Advanced Option incorrectly had damage listed as d8 (now d12)

### PDF / Offline Version of Rules

I've received number of emails asking about a printable PDF and/or an offline version of the rules. So I'm happy
to finally deliver. It's far from perfect. To reduce the amount of work, the "PDF" is generated from components on the
website. Therefore, links and buttons might not work as expected. But, it's at least a working pdf that contains all the
information on the site. You can also cache the page to your phone or computer (if you'll be without internet) and have
an offline version. There are instructions on how to do this on the page.
