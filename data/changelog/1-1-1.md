# v1.1.1


## Player's Manual Search (beta)

In this minor patch, I've added the capability to search through the player's manual. The search box is located
at the top of the side navigation menu. Currently, some of the highlighting is a bit buggy, but its functioning and 
returning decent results. 

If it crashes on you, you get strange results, or you've got other feedback, please [let us know](/contributing).
