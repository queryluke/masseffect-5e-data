## Upcoming Changes and Feedback

The next thing the development team is working on is reviewing the species. This work will cover the following:

1. Reviewing each species and making changes as necessary
1. Adding new species
1. Making the species' traits fully functioning in the Character Builder
1. Adding more Species-based feats
1. Updating the Paragon/Renegade rules
1. Adding Paragon/Renegade feats
1. Updating the PDF (as it has become very out of date)

<br>

We'd like to get community input as we work on this content update (a process we'd like to continue as we work on other
content updates). Currently we have the first round of species updates and the new paragon/renegade rules ready for review.
You can find all of the content in this public Google Drive folder

### Feedback

If you'd like to leave feedback, you've got a few options:

1. Use the [feedback form](https://forms.gle/M7p6Ffcvcnkf5KnGA)
2. Alternatively, if you want to have discussions with other community members, you can use the __#closed-play-testing__
channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/c2UnqkH)

<br>

_While you can certainly leave feedback on the #closed-play-testing channel, we recommend this channel be
reserved for discussions rather than specific recommendations or criticisms, simply because its difficult to gather feedback
by scrolling through messages._

## Bug Fixes

:::alert
Shoutout to Kael the Adventurer for making a long list of typos and needed clarifications
:::

- Correctly updated the Lucky feat to have 3 uses per long rest
- Changed "Distracting Performance" on the Musical Performance proficiency to target "sentient" creatures instead of "humanoids"
- Removed the "When you cast this at 2nd level, " clause on Unity: Shield Restore Advancement. It already is a 2nd level power.
- Any and all typos that have been pointed out on Discord or in Kael's document. If you'd like to see all of my responses
to the questions and suggestions Kael pointed out, [you can read them here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SjmEVd4Q-bDgobQj_gOK75NqJLGTVqW5/edit).
