## April Fools

Thanks for humoring us yesterday. We know April Fools jokes can be a bit tiring but we hope you got a minor chuckle.
If any one missed the April Fools content, [you can find it here](/changelog/april-fools-2022).

## 2022 Roadmap

__NOTE!__ The timelines listed below are "best case scenarios." There is a lot of web development involved in the upcoming
content and we only have two web developers who both have full-time jobs. In addition, one of the developers is the creator (me/I)
and I have to juggle bugs and content ideas/editing. I'm very committed to delivering these features as soon as possible,
but there are only so many hours in the day.

### Targeted Rules clean-up
_Release: Ongoing_

Starting today, we’ll begin polling the community for potential “problem areas”. The content moderators will review
submissions and work on targeted updates, batching the updates into smaller, more manageable releases. This work will
be ongoing and updates will all fall into the v1.4.X range of releases. If a change is disruptive enough to warrant a
version bump, we will do so. If that happens, we will pre-release the changes as playtest content so we can get feedback.

However, the goal of these targeted updates is not to make sweeping changes. Instead, we want to focus on smaller tweaks
and fixing long-standing issues.

_So what is a “problem area”?_

Problem areas confusing, broken, outdated, or any other issue about the system that we’ve heard from multiple players
and GMs. Some notorious examples are:

- Concussive shot is overpowered and needs some tweaking
- Catapult: Salvo advancement makes absolutely no sense
- Some armor set bonuses are too powerful to be considered uncommon items (for example, Maverick armor)

We will consider any suggestion provided by the community, but issues will be prioritized by:

- __Frequency of reports__
  - The more people report a problem the higher the priority
- __Specificity of the feedback__
  - More specific feedback (i.e., clearly outlined problems and it is a problem) will have a higher priority than generalized statements.
- __Scope__
  - Smaller, more targeted changes will take priority over changes that would affect multiple rules and mechanics.
- __Development Requirements__
  - Changes that require significant development to the website and/or character sheet won’t necessarily have a higher or lower priority but may take longer to release

If you would like to submit your thoughts, ideas, and/or areas where you’ve experienced problems or think the system
can do better, [you can do so via this form](https://forms.gle/XxyMKYarrSGf4DKaA) (which is also now available on the about page).

Please keep your suggestions limited to the rules/content of the system and not the website or online character builder/sheet.
Additionally, we are already working on a vehicle rules redesign so we ask that you hold your suggestions for that
content until it is released.

### New Vehicle Rules
_Release: TBD_

New vehicle rules are being designed and playtested by the discord moderator team. They will be shared out to the
community once we feel they are ready for public playtesting. Then they will be added to the website. We currently do
not have a proposed timeline for this work as it will happen concurrently with everything else on this list.
