# v100.N7.314

## Rules

No more complicated modifiers and checking for proficiencies. Flat d20 rolls until someone beats the other 5 times.

We found that the process of making an attack roll needed some tweaking. Please proceed through the following 127 page flowchart. [LINK REDACTED. SITE CAN'T HANDLE TERABYTES]

Credits have been changed to ShepCoin!

## Classes

Adepts were deemed too weak. So now they gain the Extra Attack feature at 2nd level, then again at every level after
the 2nd for a total of 20 attacks per action at 20th level.

The first inclusion of a community homebrew subclass has been added! Though there are lots of other submissions, we decided that
only the top-of-the-line submissions will be available, which means only one was added. Say hello to the Dominatrix Adept!

New 20th level capstone for Engineers: "Your power exceeds that of the devs, you become the GM"

We've continually seen rhetoric that the Tech Point system is too confusing, so we're getting rid of it entirely. You
can now cast what you have memorized for the day, at will, at any level!

"Power" slots have been reverted to "Spell" slots. No reason necessary to be given.

The Soldier's Havoc subclass has been renamed: MR. TORGUE'S SUPER AWESOME EXPLOSION SOLDIER

## Species

New Species! Halo's "Elites" are now a species due to popular demand.

All synthetic species can only speak either UwU or l33tsp34k

We brought Sexy back! Remember, the thorough "bangable-ness" of species research was not done by our team, you [can thank Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/2017/3/20/14980436/mass-effect-sexiest-character-aliens-ranked).

All species images have been updated with amazing new concept art! [See them here!!!](/species)

## Feats

Ritual caster is now a feat. No ritual powers will be available besides _praising the sun_ and _praising Grunt_.

## Weapons

Weapons that were supposed to be scaling with the Arcane stat werenâ€™t doing so properly. Should be fixed now.

## ~~Heavy~~ Thicc and Chonky Weapons

"Heavy weapons" renamed to "Thicc and Chonky weapons" to reduce confusion with the Heavy property

Targeting was proving to be quite a hot topic many times, so we changed it to the following: __If you've been able to
maintain Targeting for 1 minute with your heavy weapon, you instantly win the combat encounter with nothing left of the enemy except a mushroom cloud__

## Vehicles

The vehicle/starship combat was too confusing with the amount of different actions we had, so we changed it to just shooting back and forth at one another until one falls. Pew pew!

## Powers

New Powers:
  - Transmute Ohio
  - Greater Baja Blast

People loved the Catapult: Salvo advancement so much, we've made it the only advancement available for every power (don't tell spageddy)

Mod team agrees: Concussive Shot needed to change. It now deals 20d8 damage per shot.

## Site Features

The NPC Generator has been reverted back to the Grunt Generator and now only generates pictures of Grunt.
