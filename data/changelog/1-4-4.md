### Note from the Creator

> I wanted to let everyone know that I have effectively stepped away from content creation/management of ME5e.
> This means that the future of this system is entirely in the hands of the discord team. The introduction of these
> new classes and subclasses represents that new direction.
>
> Though I'll no longer be working on content, I will continue to maintain and host the website. But there is a
> huge difference between "maintain" and "develop". As I enter maintenance mode, the only changes that
> will happen in the future will be bug fixes and/or any content updates the discord team passes my way.
>
> Its been a fun six years, but the time has come for me to "release control" of ME5e and focus on new projects.
>
> Cheers,
>
> Luke A.
