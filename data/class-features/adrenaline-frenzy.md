At 18th level, whenever you activate Adrenaline Rush, you gain an additional Bonus Action on your turn.
You can use this bonus action only to activate your Barbed Strikes feature. You must strike the
target twice per turn as normal to use your Barbed Strikes feature.

In addition, upon activating Adrenaline Rush, you can immediately make the check
to Lunge at another target before making any attack rolls.
