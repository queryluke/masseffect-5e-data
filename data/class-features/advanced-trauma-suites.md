        Create a Trauma Suite on up to two willing allies within <me-distance length="75" /> of you for 1 minute.
        <br><br>
        You can cast First Aid on that ally as a Bonus Action instead of a normal action. You can affect all creatures currently benefiting from Trauma Suite at the same time at no additional action or power slot cost.
        <br><br>
        When you use your Transfusion ability, if you need to use your health to power that feature, you have resistance to the damage it deals to your health.
        <br><br>
        If an ally affected by Trauma Suite ally reaches zero hit points, the Trauma Suite shuts off and the ally is stabilized.
