At 13th level, your toxins are imperceptible to normal analysis. If you kill someone using Poison damage or a
poison outside of combat, that target doesn't show signs of being poisoned.

You now completely ignore Immunity to Poison damage, and are now able to poison Synthetic and Synthorganic enemies.
