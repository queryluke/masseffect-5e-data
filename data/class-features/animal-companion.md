The most crucial part of any tracker.
Starting at level 1, you gain a special beast companion, one that you perhaps created yourself, bought at an auction,
got assigned to you, or found in the wild and tamed yourself. Choose the type of animal companion from Synthetic, Brute,
All-Round, and Recon. If you choose All-Round, you may also select a type of movement speed from Swimming, Burrowing
and Climbing. Your beast gains a swimming or climbing speed equal to its walking speed, or Burrowing equal to half.

The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It moves on your turn. You can command it to move however you want
(No action required). You can use a bonus action to command it to Hide, Dodge, Dash or Disengage.

To command it to attack, you must use your action to do so. You may only give one command to your beast per turn.
For example, if you command your beast to Hide using your bonus action, you may no longer order it to attack using your action.

Add your proficiency bonus to the beastâ€™s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills
it is proficient in. Like any creature, it can spend Hit Dice during a short rest to regain hit points. Whenever you
level up, your beast's hit points increase the same way yours do. Roll its hit die and add its constitution
modifier, and add the total to its total hit points.

Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement feature, you may also increase one score of your beast by 2, or two
scores by 1. Beyond this, all beasts are proficient in Light Armor and start out wearing Light Body Armor. This also
comes with a small biotic bubble that can make the head of the beast airtight and provide it with oxygen,
letting it breathe in oxygenless areas. Whenever you find armor, you are able to modify it to fit your beast at the
cost of 3 omni gel for light armor, 5 for medium and 8 for heavy armor, or 1 for a helmet.

When your beast is reduced to 0 hit points, it makes death saving throws like a player character would. If your beast
dies, you can spend 24 hours in a natural environment to bond with a new one if your beast is organic, or spend that
same amount of time and 20 omni-gel to create a new synthetic one, or 5 if you still have the body.

As an action on your turn, you can spend one medi-gel that your beast is carrying to have your beast recover hit
points equal to 2d4+ your wisdom modifier. The healing increases to 4d4 at level 5, 6d4 at level 11, and 8d4 at level 15.
