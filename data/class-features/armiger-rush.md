At 3rd level, you learn the Havoc Strike combat power. If you already know it, instead learn one advancement to it.
If you already know one advancement of it, you know both advancements and can use either of them when you cast this
cantrip. Instead of using a charge when you cast it, you can use 1 unit of Fuel to cast it instead.
