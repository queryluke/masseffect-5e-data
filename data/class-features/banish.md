The prey could be hurt, it could be staggering, or it could be on its last legs, but you need to take it down now.
The teachings given to you have allowed you to temporarily overcharge your weapon to burst down the prey before
it gets away or it calls for help.

At 17th level, you may use this feature to Attack two additional times on top of your regular Attack(s)
this turn. You may use this ability three times per long rest.
