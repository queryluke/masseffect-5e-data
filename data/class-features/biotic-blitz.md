      Whenever you use a cantrip as part of your Attack action, you can chose to target a second
      target within range of the cantrip. This target must be different from the one you cast your cantrip against.
      As a bonus action, you can cast the cantrip against that target, but the target does not take any damage
      from Exploit: Edge that you may apply normally.
