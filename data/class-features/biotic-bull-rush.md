      When you use your action to cast Charge, you may use your bonus action to shove or make one
      weapon attack against the target. You gain +5 to the attack’s damage roll or
      shove the target <me-distance length="15" />. To shove a target this
      way, it must be no more than one size larger than you.

At 3rd level, you learn the charge cantrip. If you have already learned it, you may learn a new cantrip instead.

The distance of charge is now <me-distance length="60" />. When you use your action to cast charge, you may use a bonus action to shove or make one
weapon attack against the target. You gain +5 to the attack’s damage roll or shove the target <me-distance length="15" />. To shove a target this
way, it must be no more than one size larger than you.
