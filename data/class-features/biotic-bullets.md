At 3rd level, you have gained the ability to permeate the bullets of your thermal clip with biotic energies.
Every time you reload your weapon, and whenever you finish a short rest, half of your Heat from that reload (rounded up)
is made of Biotic Bullets.

The damage type of these bullets is Force instead of the normal damage type of your gun. Biotic Bullets can detonate primed targets.
