Starting at 14th level, you can push your biotics to the limit. If you are already maintaining a concentration power,
you can cast another power that requires concentration and maintain it. If you take damage you must make a separate
Constitution saving throw to maintain each power.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
