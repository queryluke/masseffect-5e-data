Starting at 14th level, you can push your biotic implant to the limit. If you are already maintaining a concentration
power, you can cast another power that requires concentration and maintain it. If you take damage you must make a separate Constitution
saving throw to maintain each power.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
