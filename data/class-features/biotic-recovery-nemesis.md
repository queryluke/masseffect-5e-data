At 3rd level, you have learned to regain some of your biotic energy by meditating and calming your mind. Once per day when you finish
a short rest, you can choose expended power slots to recover. The power slots can have a combined level that is equal
to or less than a third of your vanguard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 3rd level or higher.

For example, if youâ€™re a 10th-level vanguard, you can recover up to 4 levels worth of power slots. You can recover either
two 2nd-level power slots, one 2nd-level and two 1st-level power slots, or four first-level power slots.
