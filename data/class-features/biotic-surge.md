Starting at {{ level }} level, you can empower your biotics that unleash harm on groups of foes. When you force multiple 
creatures to make saving throws against the damage of one of your spells, you can increase the spell's damage by rolling 
two more of its damage dice. This increase occurs only on the turn you cast the spell.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
