At 3rd level, as you begin powering up for battle, your implant reacts strangely and surges in different ways.
Whenever you activate your barrier, roll a d8. Consult the Biotic Wrath effects (D8) table as to
the additional ability your barrier will give you.

This effect lasts until your barrier is depleted to 0 ticks or expired after its usual 1 minute duration.

##### Biotic Wrath Effects

__1__: _Your Barrier has surged in power and density, and any bullet or attack that impacts the barrier will strike back at any attacker._

Any time you roll your barrier to reduce damage from a weapon attack, the attacking creature will take force damage equal to your damage reduction roll result.

__2__: _A small ongoing surge of biotic energy emits from your barrier into a sort of biotically charged micro-storm.
You are able to channel this energy around you to strike unsuspecting foes while on your own rampage._

A spark of unstable biotic energy appears within <me-distance length="5" /> of one of creature of your choice within
<me-distance length="30" />, at the end of your current turn, each creature within <me-distance length="5" /> of the
targeted location must make a Dex save using your power save DC or take 1d8 force damage. While
your barrier is active on every other turn, this spark can be used again as a bonus action.

At 10th level, the spark's damage increases to 2d8.

__3__: _Your barrier becomes eclipsed with a secondary wave of biotic energy that arcs around you in a partially protective bubble._

While your barrier is active, all ranged attacks originating from beyond <me-distance length="30" /> away from you will have disadvantage when targeting you.

At 10th level, this protection also applies to all allied creatures within <me-distance length="5" /> of you at the time of the attack.

__4__: _Your barrier's energy matches with your battle hardened rage and is ready to unleash upon all that rush to fight you face to face._

While your barrier is active, you may spend 1 barrier tick to cast Nova as a Bonus Action, but locked to only 1 barrier
tick when calculating damage. This version of Nova ignores the requirement to spend all barrier ticks and does not
use any advancements, if known.

__5__: _Your equipped weapon temporarily becomes one with your biotic energy coursing within you._

When you perform a weapon attack while your barrier is active, you may change your damage to Force for the attack.
If you hit the target creature and it is categorised large or smaller, they must then succeed on a Strength saving
throw against your Powercasting save DC or be pushed back <me-distance length="10" /> and become knocked prone.
This effect can only be applied to one weapon per turn.

At 10th level, your enhanced weapon will also inflict an additional 1d8 force damage.

__6__: _Your barrier warps and is always changing shape, making it able to lash out at foes far away._

While your barrier is active, you may spend 1 Barrier Tick to cast Phase Disruptor at a range of <me-distance length="50" />
as a Bonus Action and add your Powercasting modifier to the damage. This version of Phase Disruptor does not
benefit from advancements, if known and is locked to one barrier tick when calculating amount of beams.

At 10th level, you may spend 2 barrier ticks to fire two beams with Phase Disruptor

__7__: _Your Barrier lashes out with unstable energy and takes essence from your foes to power it further beyond normal means._

At the time of starting your barrier, each creature of your choice within <me-distance length="30" /> of you must
succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d12 Necrotic damage. You will also gain temporary hit points equal to
1d12 plus your Vanguard level.

__8__: _You're able to channel extra energy into your barrier for more defense in the form of a vortex, surrounding you like a micro biotic tornado._

You have a bonus of +1 to your total AC.

As a Bonus Action, you may spend 1 Barrier tick to activate the vortex, performing the Dodge action. This Dodge bonus
action also coincides with kickstarting shield regeneration, as per normal rules.

At 10th level, you gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws in addition to your AC bonus.
