At {{ level }} level, you have achieved such mastery over certain biotics that you can cast them at will. Choose two 1st-level
biotic spells that you have learned. You can cast those spells at 1st level without
expending a spell slot. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours training, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.
