You learn how to use your biotic power to blink short distances. At 6th level you can use your movement action to
blink. If you do, you only move half of your movement rate, but your movement does not provoke attack of opportunities
during your turn. In addition, you may phase through 2 meters of solid matter per movement. If you end your
movement inside of a solid structure, you are shunted to the nearest open space and suffer 1d10 damage per
2 meters you had to move to be out of the surface.

You can blink your entire movement rate at 18th level
