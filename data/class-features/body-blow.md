    shortDesc: >-
      When you make an attack roll with an unarmed strike on your turn and hit, you can spend your
      bonus action to attempt a Body Blow. If you do, roll the attack again, using the same modifiers, against the
      same AC number of the target. If you hit this second attack, it deals no damage, but the target is <me-condition id="stunned" /> for 1 round.
      If your Body Blow roll is a critical hit, the target is instead <me-condition id="paralyzed" /> for 1 round.
