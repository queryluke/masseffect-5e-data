      Touch a creature and that creature rolls a d3 (roll a d6 and halve the result, rounded up). That creature
      regains an expended Biotic Power slot of the number rolled or lower (Sentinels however will simply regain a single
      expended power slot, no roll required). Once a creature receives this benefit, that creature can't
      receive it again until after a long rest.

At 6th level, the surge of your biotic powers has become wild enough to arc into others and rejuvenate their own stamina
to use more biotics when they need them.

As an Action, you can touch a creature and that creature rolls a d3 (roll a d6 and halve the result, rounded up). That creature
regains an expended Biotic Power slot of the number rolled or lower (Sentinels however will simply regain a single
expended power slot, no roll required). Once a creature receives this benefit, that creature can't
receive it again until after a long rest.
