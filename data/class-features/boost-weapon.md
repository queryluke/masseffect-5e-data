By channeling either power from your Omni-tool or from your biotic reserves, you can boost the damage of your Personal
Armament. When you make an attack, you may spend a spell slot. If you do, your shot deals an extra 1d8, plus 1d8
damage per spell level spent. If you spent a Biotic Spell, you deal Necrotic Damage. If you spent a Tech Power,
you deal Lightning Damage. This damage can detonate primed targets.
