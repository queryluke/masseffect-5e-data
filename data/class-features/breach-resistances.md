At 7th level, the added force of your melee strikes from your Power Slam sunders armor under it's blows. While you
have Tech Armor active, whenever you hit an enemy with a power and melee attack from Power Slam, you ignore their
resistances, and treat immunities as resistance for that attack only. If your enemy has no
resistances, then, for 1 minute after your attack lands, they lose 1 point of AC.
