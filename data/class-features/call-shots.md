Starting at 10th level, you can use your action to focus all of your attention on your tactical focus, calling out
threats, troop movements, and enemy weaknesses.

Until the start of your next turn:

- Whenever a friendly creature makes an attack roll or saving throw, it rolls 1d6 and adds the result to its attack roll or saving throw.
- Whenever a hostile creature makes an attack roll or saving throw, it rolls 1d6 and subtracts the result to its attack roll or saving throw.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your powercasting modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended
uses when you finish a long rest.
