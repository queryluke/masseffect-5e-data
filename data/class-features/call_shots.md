Starting at {{ level }} level, you can use your action to focus all of your attention on your tactical focus, calling out
threats, troop movements, and enemy weaknesses.

Until the start of your next turn:

- Whenever a friendly creature makes an attack roll or saving throw, it rolls 1d6 and adds the result to its attack roll or saving throw.
- Whenever a hostile creature makes an attack roll or saving throw, it rolls 1d6 and subtracts the result to its attack roll or saving throw.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended
uses when you finish a long rest.
