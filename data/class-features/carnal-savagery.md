you. You move up to the creature at high speed, then make a melee weapon attack. Regardless of whether the
creature fulfills the conditions, it takes the bonus damage from Power From Pain. Afterwards,
select another creature within <me-distance length="15" /> of your new position, and repeat.

You can repeat this until you’ve attacked a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus. You cannot
