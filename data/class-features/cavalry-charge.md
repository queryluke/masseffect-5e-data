        After you roll Initiative, choose {{ chaMod }} creatures (min 1). Until the
        end of their next turn, those creatures have their movement speed doubled the first time they move and gain the
        benefits of your Shock Calvary feature. Use your DC when determining the saving throws caused by Shock Calvary.
name: Cavalry Charge
---
Starting at 14th level, your capabilities of overwhelming the enemy with a sudden charge extends to your allies.
Creatures have had their movement speed increased by Leading the Charge gain the effects of Shock Cavalry for as
long as their movement speed is increased.

The DC for your allies attempting to frighten targets is the same as your DC. A creature can only be
frightened by the effects of Shock Cavalry once, and cannot be frightened of multiple users of Shock Cavalry.
