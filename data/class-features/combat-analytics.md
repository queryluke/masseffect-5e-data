At 7th level, your scanning suite provides you with feedback against your enemies' fighting style, letting you better
protect from their advances. Whenever an enemy you have marked with Tactical Sweep hits an attack against you, or
you fail a saving throw against them, you gain +1 to your AC or to the type of save that you failed.
This bonus stacks, up to a maximum of your Intelligence modifier (minimum +1). This bonus lasts until the
end of your next turn.
