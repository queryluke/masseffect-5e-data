At 1st level, you know three combat powers of your choice from the soldier power list. You learn additional combat powers of
your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Combat Powers column of the Soldier table.

Instead of learning a new combat power, you may instead learn the advanced version of a combat power you already know.
