At 2nd level, you know one combat power of your choice from the tracker power list. You learn additional combat powers
of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Combat Powers column of the Tracker table.

Instead of learning a new combat power, you may instead learn the advanced version of a combat power you already know.
