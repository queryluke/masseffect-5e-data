At 14th level, your body is starting to truly acclimatise to the changes that have happened to your L3 implant. Whenever
you roll on the Biotic Wrath table, you now roll two d8s and choose one of the two results rolled from
the Biotic Wrath table. If you roll doubles (e.g. Two 4s), you may freely choose which effect takes place.
