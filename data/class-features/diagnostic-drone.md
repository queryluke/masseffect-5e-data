Your skill with using VI's and tech allow you to recharge a few of your powers. At 10th level, whenever you take a
short rest, you can choose spend a few minutes tinkering with your Omni-tool and focusing to recover half your expended
power slots. These recovered power slots must be split evenly between Biotic and Tech.
Once you use this feature, you must complete a long rest before using it again.

At 20th level, you can use this feature twice per long rest.
