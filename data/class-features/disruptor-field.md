At 10th level, your Power Armor can emit a field of electromagnetic radiation that helps divert attacks aimed at it.
On your turn, you can chose to spend your bonus action activating the field. If you do so, attacks made against you
have disadvantage until the beginning of your next turn.

If you activate this ability, you cannot attack twice with your Integrated Weaponry. If you have already
attacked twice with your Integrated Weaponry during this turn, you cannot activate Disruptor Field.
