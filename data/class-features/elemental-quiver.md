At 10th level, you can blend other powers into your arrows. The power with which you have selected your
Engineer's Eficiency now affects some properties of your arrows. These choices are made per arrow,
and can be taken after the arrow hits (no action required).

__Incinerate__: You can spend 1 tech point to Prime (Fire) your target, 1 tech point to give your a -2 to any to hit rolls it makes until the end of it's next turn, or 1 tech point to detonate the Prime (Fire) condition

__Cryo Blast__: You can spend 1 tech point to Prime (Cold) your target, 1 tech point to halve your target's movement speed, or 3 to give your target the Frozen condition

__Overload__: You can spend 1 tech point to Prime (Lightning) your target, 1 tech point to deal minimum damage to an adjacent target, or 3 to do both and Prime (Lightning) both targets.
