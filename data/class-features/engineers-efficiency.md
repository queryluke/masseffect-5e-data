Starting at {{ level }} level, you're able to optimize a basic tech power. Choose one of the following
tech powers: Cryo Blast, Incinerate, or Overload. You always have this power prepared. You may cast a 1 tech point version
of this power without expending any tech points. If you cast the power at a high level, you must spend all tech points as normal.

You can prepare the advanced version of the selected power at the cost of 1 prepared power.

At 11th level, you can cast a 2 tech point version of this power without expending any tect points.

With 8 hours of programming your omni-tool, you can exchange the selected power with either Cryo Blast, Incinerate, or Overload.
