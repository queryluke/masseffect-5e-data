      Target one enemy within range, expend a power slot, and roll your exploit die. The target loses powers
      depending on the roll of your Exploit die. A caster with power slots loses power slots from their highest to
      their lowest, using up the number you rolled per slot. A caster with Tech Points looses an amount of tech
      points equal to double the number you rolled.

      When you use Exploit: Disrupt, you cannot cast a cantrip or a power for an amount of turns equal to the number you
      rolled on your exploit die, as your own implants shut down momentarily.

At 10th level, as an action, you can target one enemy you can see within <me-distance length="75" /> of you.
Expend one power slot and roll your Exploit die once. The target loses powers depending on the roll of your
Exploit die. A caster with power slots loses power slots from their highest to their lowest, using up the
number you rolled per slot (ie a third level power slot takes 3 off the number, a second level takes 2 off, and so on).
A caster with Tech Points looses an amount of tech points equal to double the number you rolled.

When you use Exploit: Disrupt, you cannot cast a cantrip or a power for an amount of turns equal to the number you
rolled on your exploit die, as your own implants shut down momentarily.
