      At the end of a short or long rest, you may choose a weapon you posses and roll your Exploit Die. The chosen
      weapon gains a bonus to damage rolls equal to the roll and your hit point maximum is reduced by the
      amount equal to the result of your Exploit Die roll.

Also at 2nd level, you can leverage part of your biology into stronger attacks at the cost of your own well being. At
the end of a short or long rest, you may choose a weapon you posses and roll your Exploit Die, gaining the following effects:

- The chosen weapon gains a bonus to damage rolls equal to one roll of your Exploit Die. This damage is the same type the weapon normally deals.
- Your hit point maximum is reduced by the amount equal to the result of your Exploit Die roll.

Both effects last until you finish a short or long rest or until you use this feature again at the end of a short or long rest.
