      When you are forced to make a saving throw roll you Exploit Die and add the result to your roll.
      For a number of turns equal to one roll of your Exploit Die, you succeed on a {{ dc }} Constitution saving
      throw or be Poisoned for that turn. You cannot use Exploit: Guard to gain a bonus on the
      saving throw against this effect.

At 7th level, you can use your changes to protect against incoming effects. When you are forced to roll a saving throw,
you can spend your reaction to grant yourself a bonus on the saving throw equal to one roll of your Exploit Die.
However, using your augmentations like this is taxing on your body. For a number of turns equal to one roll of your
Exploit Die, you must make a Constitution saving throw vs your Exploit DC or be Poisoned for that turn.
You cannot use Exploit: Guard to gain a bonus on the saving throw against this effect.
