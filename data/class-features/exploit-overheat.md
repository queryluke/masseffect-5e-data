At 10th level, as an action, you can choose a target within <me-distance length="80" /> of yourself who is either
using a weapon that requires thermal clips or who is using armor. If a target is both using a thermal clip powered
weapon and wearing armor, you choose which to affect. Roll your Exploit Die. If you chose to target a
weapon, that weapon jams and needs to be cleared as an action next round. If you chose to target armor,
it's servos lock up, cutting the target's movement in half until it spends an action rebooting it.
Whichever the case, your target takes your Exploit Die + your Constitution modifier damage and is Primed Fire.

You can use this exploit once per short rest without issue. If you try and use it again without properly cooling
down yourself, you take damage equal to the damage you dealt to your foe, and you become Primed Fire.
