At 2nd level, when you apply Exploit: Edge to one of your weapons, you can chose to instead have the
damage be Force damage instead of the same damage the weapon would normally apply.

Additionally, when you cast a cantrip, you can roll your Exploit Die and add it as damage to the
damage roll of your cantrip. The damage dealt this way is the same as the damage type of the
cantrip, and it is only applied once (lingering effects don't enjoy this bonus)
