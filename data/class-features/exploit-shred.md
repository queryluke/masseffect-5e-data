      When you hit an enemy with a weapon that has your Exploit: Edge applied to it, use a bonus action. Then
      the target makes a {{ dc }} Constitution saving throw. On a failure, roll an Exploit Die, and
      your enemy subtracts half of the number rolled from either their AC or their attack rolls
      for the next minute. Your enemy gets a new save to end the effect early
      at the end of every one of their turns.
      <br><br>
      Every time you use Exploit: Shred, you take necrotic damage equal to double the number you rolled on
      your Exploit die, as using your features as violently as this damages your physiology.

At 15th level, when you hit an enemy with a weapon that has your Exploit: Edge applied to it, you can spend a
bonus action to shred the target's defense or offense. Your target makes a Constitution saving throw: on a failure,
roll an Exploit Die, and your enemy subtracts half of the number rolled from either their AC or their attack rolls
for the next minute. Your enemy gets a new save to end the effect early at the end of every one of their turns.

Every time you use Exploit: Shred, you take necrotic damage equal to double the number you rolled on
your Exploit die, as using your features as violently as this damages your physiology.
