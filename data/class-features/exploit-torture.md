At 10th level, as an action, you can chose up to your proficiency modifier creatures in a <me-distance length="25" abbr />
radius that you can see. These creatures must make a Wisdom Saving throw with a DC equal to your Exploit DC plus your
Indoctrinated level. On a failure, they become Frightened and at the end of each of their turns, must make the
saving throw again or take psychic damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die + half your Experiment level.
On a success, the effect ends for that creature. This is a Concentration effect.

When this effect ends on all victims, the neural feedback produced by the effect washes over your implants and
overwhelms your mind. You take psychic damage equal to one roll of you Exploit die per target you affected, and you
become Confused until the end of your next turn.

You become Indoctrinated 3.
