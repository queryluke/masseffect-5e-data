At 2nd level, your body has adapted somewhat to the augmentations that have been put inside of your body. You gain an
Exploit Die, shown in the class table for the Experiment. It starts out as a 1d4 and increases as you gain levels in
the Experiment class. Your class features use the die shown in the table when they call for an Exploit Die roll

Whenever one of your class features require a saving throw, the DC for it is 8 + your proficiency + your Constitution Modifier.
