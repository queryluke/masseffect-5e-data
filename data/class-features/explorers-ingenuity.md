Your quick thinking lets you apply creative solutions to incoming problems. At 3rd level, select one of your saving
throws that isn't Intelligence. You may add your Intelligence modifier to that saving throw if you'd be affected by an
effect you can see. At 7th, 11th, 15th and 19th level, you select another non-Intelligence saving throw to
apply your modifier to. At 11th level, you can spend a reaction to also grant this benefit to an ally within
10 meters of your position that you can see.
