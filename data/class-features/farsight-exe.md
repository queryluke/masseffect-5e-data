At 7th level, your hologram is advanced enough to send you an image feed of what it can see. While you have your
hologram out, your omni-tool displays to you a feed of what your hologram is seeing, allowing you to
observe the world through it's "senses".

You can also use an action to focus your senses and improve you hologram. When you do this, you are blinded and
deafened, but can see and hear normally from your hologram's position. In addition, when you do this,
your hologram can move up to <me-distance length="750" /> from your position, instead of <me-distance length="25" />.
