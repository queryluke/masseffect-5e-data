      You can chose to expend a use of Inspiration as a reaction to an ally being targeted by an attack or when an enemy
      is subject to a saving throw. You must chose to use this feature before the attack is made or the saving throw is rolled.
      When you do so, you roll the Inspiration die and your enemy subtracts that amount from their roll.
