__Brawler.__ Add your proficiency bonus to your melee attack damage rolls.

__Carnage.__ When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a shotgun, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

__Close-Quarters Shooter.__ When making a ranged attack while you are within <me-distance length="5" /> of a hostile
creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half-cover against targets within <me-distance length="25" /> of you.

__Defense.__ +1 AC.

__The Free Hand__ When holding no more than one light, non-two-handed weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to hit with ranged power attacks.

__Protection.__ When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within <me-distance length="5" />
of you, you can use your reaction and expend one barrier tick to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. If the attack
hits, the damage is reduced by your barrier tick roll.

__Sniper.__ If no hostile creature is within <me-distance length="25" /> of you, gain +2 to damage rolls on attacks
made with a sniper rifle.
