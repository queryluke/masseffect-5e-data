At 17th level, when you take the Attack action with a Heavy Pistol, you can chose to fire your pistol a number of times
equal to your proficiency modifier. These shots can be aimed at one person or at several, and Sneak Attack can be
applied once to each person you aim at if they fulfill the conditions for Sneak Attack.

Once you use this feature, your weapon runs out of Heat (no matter how much heat remained in your weapon) and must
be reloaded and cooled down using an action on your next turn. You must use an action to do this: it cannot be
reduced to a bonus action by any means, and it can't be done as part of the Attack action via Lightning Reload.
Until you take this special reload action, your pistol is jammed and cannot fire.
