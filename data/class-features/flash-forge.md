At 2nd level, when you use an omni-weapon, you can also decide what damage type it deals until the next turn.
You can chose between Bludgeoning, Piercing or Slashing. At 10th level, you add Electric, Fire and Cold to that list.
At 18th level, add Necrotic and Radiant to that list.

You gain a +1 to attack and damage with omni-weapons.
