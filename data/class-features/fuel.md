At 3rd level, you modified your armor to install the Armiger's signature JumpPack, and also install the system to
provide it with Fuel. Your armor automatically regenerates Fuel when you take a short or long rest, and the amount of
Fuel you have in your tank is equal to your proficiency modifier + a physical modifier of your
choosing (Dex, Str, Con. You make this choice when you choose this subclass and it cannot be changed).
