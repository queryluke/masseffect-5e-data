At 2nd level, you can focus your biotic abilities to make them more powerful, but you sacrifice distance to your
target to do it. When you cast a power that deals damage, if it isn't already a melee power attack, you may chose to
turn it into a melee power attack. If you do so, the attack bypasses shields, and you gain +1 to the damage
roll of the power per damage die rolled.
