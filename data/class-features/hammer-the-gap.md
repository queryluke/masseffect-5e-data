At 7th level, you gain a better understanding of small arms. You gain the Ambidextrous Fighting Style. If you already
have that Fighting Style, you may select another fighting style of your choice.

Whenver you make an attack with a small arm (Heavy Pistol or SMG) on your turn, you gain a
stacking +1 bonus to all damage rolls for every shot after the first one
(your first shot is performed at no bonus, the second has +1, the third +2, etc...). This damage lasts until the end of your current turn.
