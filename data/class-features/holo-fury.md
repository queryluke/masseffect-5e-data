At 3rd level, when you take the Attack action and have a Hologram out, you can make an additional attack from the
hologram's position. When you gain the Extra Attack feature, you can make one attack in addition to your standard
number of attacks per turn (at 5th level, you can attack three times per action. At 11th, 4 times, and at 20th, 5 times).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency modifier. You regain all uses of this feature when you take a long rest.
