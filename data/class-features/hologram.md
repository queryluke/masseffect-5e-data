At 3rd level, you can create a lifelike hologram of yourself within <me-distance length="15" /> of your current
location as a bonus action. The hologram stays active until you dismiss it (no action required), it is hit or you try
and create another hologram. On your turn, you can command your hologram to move <me-distance length="25" /> in any
direction (no action required). If your hologram is more than <me-distance length="25" /> from you at the end
of your turn, it is automatically dismissed.

The hologram has an AC of 14+Your Proficiency Modifier, has 1 hit point, and is immune to all
conditions and priming. If it has to make a saving throw, it uses your modifiers for that saving throw.

- When you take the attack action on your turn, or cast a Combat Power that necessitates you aim or target
an area, you can make your attacks or draw that area from your hologram's position: the damage of the
attack turns to Lightning.

- When a creature moves through the Hologram's threatened area (all adjacent squares to it), you can use your reaction
to make an opportunity attack against the target. This attack deals 1d6+your strength or dexterity modifier Lightning
damage, and is considered a melee attack.
