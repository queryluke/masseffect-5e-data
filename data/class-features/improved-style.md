At 9th level, you can choose another Fighting Style. Alternatively, you can select your fighting Style again,
which improves it in the following ways:

__Improved Ambidextrous__: Whenever you make a reaction attack, you can make an attack with both of your weapons. You can also reload two weapons with the same action.

__Improved Assault__: When you make a Burst Fire attack, the DC of the saving throw increases by an additional +1 per creature in the area of effect.

__Improved Brawler__: Any enemy you hit with a melee attack has their speed halved for the rest of the round. If you hit a target with an attack of opportunity with a melee weapon, their speed becomes 0 instead.

__Improved Carnage__: When you reroll a die that landed on a 1 or a 2, you an roll twice and pick the highest result.

__Improved Close Quarters Shooter__: When making a ranged attack while you are within 2m of a hostile creature, you now gain advantage on the attack roll against it. Your ranged attacks now igore full cover against targets within 10m of you.

__Improved Defense__: You gain an additional +1 AC while wearing armor.

__Improved Free Hand__: You may benefit from the bonus of this style when wielding any weapon.

__Improved Protection__: Your ally gains resistance to the damage type of the triggering attack.

__Improved Sniper__: Your bonus to damage becomes +4
