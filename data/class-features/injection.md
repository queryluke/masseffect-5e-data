At 9th level, instead of striking with your Sneak Attack, you can use your poisons by themselves. If you haven't used
your Sneak Attack this round, you can use your Cunning Action to fire off a dart of poison towards an enemy within
30 feet. This dart deals damage equal to your sneak attack damage, is Poison damage, and applies a Toxin
if you so chose. Targets hit by Injection have disadvantage on any saving throws against Toxin effects.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency bonus per long rest.
