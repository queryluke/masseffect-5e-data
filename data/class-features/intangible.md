At 9th level, your molecules are so loose you gain some measure of protection even when you stop. Whenever you're the
target of an attack and you moved at least half your speed on your last turn, you can use your reaction to roll a d6.
On a 3 or lower, the attack misses you. You can use this feature after the attack has been rolled.
