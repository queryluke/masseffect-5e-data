At 6th level, you integrate a non-heavy weapon into your Power Armor. You can change what weapon it is during a
long rest if you have access to the weapon you wish to integrate instead. Your integrated weapon has the following properties:

- If the weapon has the Heavy property, it lacks that property while it is integrated into your power armor.
- You can use your Intelligence Modifier for the attack and damage rolls of the weapon.
- You can attack twice instead of once when you take the Attack action, but only if you attack both times using your integrated weapon.
