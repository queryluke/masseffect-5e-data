You've developed a special omni-tool program, given to you by your predecessors that allows you to use your omni-tool
as a sort of grappling hook to stop perpetrators from escaping from you.

At 3rd level, you learn the Justice combat power. If you already know Justice, you gain one of its enhancements.
If you already have a Justice advancement, you learn an additional combat power of your choice from the Soldier list.

This does not count towards your total number of Combat Powers.
