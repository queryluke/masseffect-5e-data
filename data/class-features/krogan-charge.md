At 10th level, if you move <me-distance length="15" /> before your Power Slam, increase the damage die of both the
power damage and the weapon damage by one. If you move <me-distance length="25" /> before your Power Slam, in addition
to the damage die increase, your attack can crit on a roll of 19 or 20, if a roll of 19 would allow you to hit the enemy's AC.

This movement needs to be in a straight line.
