At 7th level, when you start your turn without a creature within melee range and your Blade Armor is active, you can
try to lunge at a creature you can see. Make an Athletics check, opposed by your target's own Athletics check.
If you succeed, you can move up to double your movement speed towards your target. If you fail, you move
only half your speed towards your target. If you end this movement adjacent to your target, you
gain advantage on your first melee attack against them this turn.
