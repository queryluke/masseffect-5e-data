At 3rd level, you have gained enough control over your new biology that your Main Augment can manifest itself fully

You can choose your Main Augment from the following list, each with their own advantages that cater to a specific
style of play.

__Integrated Weaponry__: Your body has integrated weapons located somewhere.
This can vary from a bionic arm that you are now used to enough to swing, or blades that only now you've
grown used to. Choose a physical damage type: Bludgeoning, Slashing, or Piercing. This is the base damage of your
weapon. Next, chose if it is a melee weapon or a ranged weapon. You make attack rolls with this weapon using your
Constitution Modifier. If you chose a melee weapon, it deals 2d6 + your Constitution Modifier damage. If it is a
ranged weapon, it deals 1d8 + your Constitution Modifier damage, and has a range of <me-distance length="50" abbr/>/<me-distance length="100" abbr/>.

__Integrated Processor__: You have an integrated processor installed inside of your brain, that helps
modulate responses to your nervous system and parses information for you, allowing you to better focus on your
tasks. You gain proficiency in Dexterity and Wisdom saving throws, and you gain Expertise in two skills you are already proficient in.

__Integrated Plating__: Your body has been implanted with experimental plating underneath the skin,
that help you stay alive. You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Constitution modifier if you are wearing Light Armor.
