Having a lot of experience with riding, you and your beast are perfectly synchronized and capable of mounting and dismounting with trained ease.

Starting at 7th level, you can mount and dismount using only <me-distance length="5" /> of movement speed, instead
of half your movement speed. You gain advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off
your mount and descend no more than <me-distance length="10" />, you can land on your feet if you're not incapacitated.
