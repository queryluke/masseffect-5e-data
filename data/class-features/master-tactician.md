At 3rd level, you can use the Help action as a bonus action. Additionally, when you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking
a creature, the target of that attack can be within <me-distance length="50" /> of you, rather than <me-distance length="5" /> of you, if the target can see or hear you.
