At 3rd level, you gain the ability to use the power stored in your barrier to twist your powers to suit your needs.
You gain two of the following Metabiotic options of your choice.

Metabiotics can only be applied to powers of 1st level or higher.

Name | Enhancement
--- | ---
Careful power | When you cast a power that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the power's full force. To do so, you spend 1 barrier tick and choose a number of those creatures up to your powercasting ability modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the power.
Distant power | When you cast a power that has a range of <me-distance length="5" /> or greater, you can spend 1 barrier tick to double the range of the power. When you cast a power that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 barrier tick to make the range of the power <me-distance length="30" />.
Empowered power | When you roll damage for a power, you can spend 1 barrier tick to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your powercasting ability modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls. You can use Empowered power even if you have already used a different Metabiotic option during the casting of the power.
Heightened power | When you cast a power that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 barrier ticks to give one target of the power disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the power.
Quickened power | When you cast a power that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 barrier ticks to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.
Twinned power | When you cast a power that doesn't have a range of self and is incapable of targeting more than one creature at the power's current level, you can spend a number of barrier ticks equal to the power's level to target a second creature in range with the same power.
