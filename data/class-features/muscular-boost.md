At 6th level, the implants along your body supplement your physical strength. When you make an attack that uses
Strength, you instead can chose to use your Intelligence for both the attack and damage roll. If you do so for a
melee attack, you can add half of your proficiency bonus and half of your intelligence bonus again to the damage roll.
