At 3rd level, your nanomachines harden in response to physical trauma, protecting you from physical damage. When you
aren't wearing any armor and not using a Riot Shield, your AC is equal to 12+ your Constitution Modifier.

In addition, you can install mods into your own person. Doing so costs twice as much omni-gel as it would normally
cost to install an armor mod normally, and you can't use credits for this process. You can install 2 chest mods,
one helmet mod, one arm mod and one leg mod.
