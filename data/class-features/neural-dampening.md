At 9th level, you gain resistance to Psychic, Necrotic and Force damage, and an enemy that deals Psychic, Necrotic or
Force damage to you must make a saving throw vs your powercasting modifier or take half of the damage it dealt to you.
This return damage is not reduced by resistance, but it does not bypass immunities.
