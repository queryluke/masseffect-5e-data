At 2nd level, you gain access to the Omni-Bow. The Omni-Bow is a special Omni-Tool weapon that can fire flash-forged
arrows at high speeds. With your Omni-Bow, you can make a special attack once per turn, which is represented as a power, Bowshot.

Attacking with Bowshot counts as the Casting a Power action, not the Attack Action.
