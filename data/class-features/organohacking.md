At 14th level, your mastery over the technology within you makes it easier to affect synthetics and computers.
When you critically hit a creature with a weapon using Exploit: Edge's Lightning damage, it must succeed on an
Intelligence saving throw vs your Exploit DC. On a failure, the creature's implants or mechanical processors are
hacked, and the target becomes Confused. At the end of its rounds, the creature can make a new Intelligence
saving throw to end the effect, which lasts for 1 minute at most.
