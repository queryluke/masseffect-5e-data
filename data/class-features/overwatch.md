    shortDesc: When one of your overwatch target moves from 1/2- or 3/4-cover, make a ranged weapon attack. The attack benefits from your Sneak Attack if you have not used sneak attack on the target this turn.

At 13th level, you've become attuned to monitoring the movements of the battlefield, taking advantage of
when enemies break cover.

At the end of each of your turns, you may ready the following action. Choose up to 5 creatures you can see that are behind
half or three-quarter cover. Until the start of your next turn, if any of those creatures move into an area providing
no cover, you may use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack targeting that creature. This attack can benefit from
your Sneak Attack even if you have already used it this turn, but you can't use your Sneak Attack against the same target
more than once in a turn.
