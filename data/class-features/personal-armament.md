While not as focused as a Soldier, your expertise in combat lends itself to expertly tweaking one of your armaments.
At level 2, you select one weapon you currently own. By spending eight hours preparing and tinkering with the weapon,
you gain a series of benefits, the first of which is the ability to use complex algorithms to help with aiming.
You use your Intelligence modifier in your To Hit and Damage rolls, instead of the usual modifier, and you ignore
the physical requirements to wield it.
