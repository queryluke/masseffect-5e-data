At 14th level, your mastery of Noxious Gas and/or Fuel Spill show. Depending on your Pick your Poison choice,
that power improves in these respective ways:

__Noxious Gas__: When a creature that makes the saving throw fails, not only do they take damage, they must also use
their next action to vomit or hack, as the toxins upset their digestive systems. This effect only occurs if the
Noxious Cloud is still present at the start of that creature's turn. Creatures with no discernible digestive systems
to note (Synthetics) are immune to this effect.

__Fuel Spill__: The fuel becomes more viscous and even harder to move in. While covered in it, a creatures movement
speed is halved and they gain a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws. Additionally, to remove the fuel,
they must make a Strength (Athletics) check to remove it.
