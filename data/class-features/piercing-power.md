At 10th level, your powers can pierce through organic matter and keep going. When you cast a power and chose to reduce
it's damage die size to make it bypass shields, the power also targets another target behind your primary target.
Alternatively, you can chose to instead make your power phase through solid non organic matter, allowing it to bypass all cover.
