At 2nd level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor. You also gain or create a special set of armor, hereby
called your Power Armor. Your Power Armor is a special suit of heavy armor that has the same mod slots as a fully
moddable suit of Heavy Armor: 3 slots for the chest and head, and 2 mod slots for arms and legs. Your
Power Armor also grants you the following benefits:

- If the armor normally has a Strength requirement, the power armor lacks this requirement for you.
- The power armor attaches to you and canâ€™t be removed against your will. It also expands to cover your entire body, and it replaces any missing limbs, functioning identically to a body part it is replacing.
