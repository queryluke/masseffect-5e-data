At 3rd level, when you cast an offensive power (like Incinerate or Warp) or a biotic cantrip that does damage, you can
transfer that power onto a melee weapon you are wielding. As part of that same action, you can swing your weapon at
an adjacent opponent. If you miss, the power does nothing and you lose the power slot if you used one. If you hit, the
target takes damage both from the weapon attack and the power discharged.

Even if the power affects multiple opponents or an area, when used like this, the power only affects the target of the
melee attack.
