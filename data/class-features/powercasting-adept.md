### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the adept power list. You learn additional adept cantrips of
your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Adept table.

Instead of learning a new cantrip, you may instead learn the advanced version of a cantrip you already know.

### Power Slots
The Adept table shows how many power slots you have to cast your powers of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these
adept powers, you must expend a slot of the powerâ€™s level or higher. You regain all expended power slots when you finish
a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level power lance and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level power slot available, you can
cast lance using either slot.

### Powers Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know three 1st-level powers of your choice from the adept power list.

The powers Known column of the Adept table shows when you learn more adept powers of your choice. Each of these powers
must be of a level for which you have power slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn
one new power of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you learn a new power, you may instead choose one of the powers you know and learn an advanced
version of it. You select one of the advancement options listed in the power description. Whenever you cast the power,
you cast the advanced version of it. You can only learn one advancement for each power.

### Powercasting Ability

Adepts have an L5x biotic implant which requires conscious control over their nervous system. As an Adept, you use your
Wisdom whenever a power refers to your powercasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the
saving throw DC for a biotic power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

__Power save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

__Power attack modifier__ = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
