### Casting powers
The Engi Knight Powers table shows how many Tech Points you have to cast your powers of 1st level or higher. To cast one
of these powers using the Engineer's power list, you must expend a number of Tech Points equal to the power's level or
higher. You regain all expended Tech Points when you finish a long rest.

You are limited in the number of Tech Points you can spend to use a power as indicated in the Tech Point
Limit column of the Engi Knight table.

For example, a 9th level Engi Knight can cast powers for 1 or 2 Tech Points

### Powers Known of 1st Level and Higher
Starting at 3rd level, you know two 1st-level powers of your choice from the Engineer power list. The Powers Known
column of the Engi Knight table shows when you learn more Engineer powers of your choice. Each of these powers must
be of a level for which you have Tech Points. For instance, when you reach 10th level in this subclass,
you can learn one new power of 1st or 2nd level.

Engi Knights cannot use advancements to Engineer Powers, nor can your choice of learned powers be changed after
learning them as your AI is utilising these abilities on the Soldier's behalf, not the Soldier
maintaining the Omni-tool like an Engineer would.

### Powercasting Ability
Engi Knights use a modified Omni-tool, maintained by your onboard Armor/Suit AI. As a Engi Knight, you use your
Intelligence whenever a Tech Power refers to your Powercasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence
modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Tech Power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

__Power save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

__Power attack modifier__ = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
