### Power Slots
The Explorer table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of
your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your sentinel spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a
spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell Lance,
you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.

### Powers Known of 1st Level and Higher
An Explorer always knows all of the spells in their spell list. However, they cannot have all of them prepared at the same time.

At the tail end of each long rest, an Explorer can chose up to half his Explorer level+his intelligence modifier spells.
He considers those spells as his prepared spells for the day, and may cast them using the spell slots at their disposal.

Your prepared spells list must be equally split between Biotic Spells and Tech Spells. If the number of prepared spells
you have is odd, you may chose what kind of spell the spell that remains is after splitting the list
between biotic and tech equally.

When you select your spells, you may choose to spend one prepared spell to instead prepare an advanced version of a
spell you are preparing. You may only have one advancement per spell.

### Powercasting Ability

Explorers use a unique L5x biotic implant that integrates with the operative's omni-tool maximizes their innate talents.
As an explorer, the amount of information needed to process and optimize these systems makes your Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence.

__Power save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

__Power attack modifier__ = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
