### Power Slots
The Explorer table shows how many power slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of
your power slots are the same level. To cast one of your sentinel powers of 1st level or higher, you must expend a
power slot. You regain all expended power slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 2nd-level power slots. To cast the 1st-level power Lance,
you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level power.

### Powers Known of 1st Level and Higher
An Explorer always knows all of the powers in their power list. However, they cannot have all of them prepared at the same time.

At the tail end of each long rest, an Explorer can chose up to half his Explorer level+his intelligence modifier powers.
He considers those powers as his prepared powers for the day, and may cast them using the power slots at their disposal.

Your prepared powers list must be equally split between Biotic powers and Tech powers. If the number of prepared powers
you have is odd, you may chose what kind of power the power that remains is after splitting the list
between biotic and tech equally.

When you select your powers, you may choose to spend one prepared power to instead prepare an advanced version of a
power you are preparing. You may only have one advancement per power.

### Powercasting Ability

Explorers use a unique L5x biotic implant that integrates with the operative's omni-tool maximizes their innate talents.
As an explorer, the amount of information needed to process and optimize these systems makes your powercasting Ability
Intelligence.

__Power save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
