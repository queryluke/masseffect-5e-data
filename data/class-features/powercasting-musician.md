### Preparing and casting powers
The Musician table shows how many tech points you have to cast your powers of 1st level and higher. To cast one of
these musician powers, you must expend a number of tech points equal to the powerâ€™s level or higher. You regain
all expended tech points when you finish a long rest.

You are limited in the number of tech points you can spend to cast a power as indicated in the Tech Point Limit
column of the Musician table.

For example, a 9th-level musician can cast powers for 1, or 2 tech points.

You prepare the list of musician powers that are available for you to cast, choosing from the musician power list.
When you do so, choose a number of musician powers equal to your Charisma modifier + your musician level (minimum of one power).

You may prepare the advanced version of a power for the cost of 2 regular versions. You may only prepare one advanced version for each power.

For example, if you are a 4th-level musician with a Charisma of 16, your list of prepared powers can be one of the following:

- seven regular powers
- one advanced power and five regular powers
- two advanced powers and three regular powers
- three advanced powers and one regular power

<br>

You can also change your list of prepared powers when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of musician powers
requires time spent to program them into your omni-tool: at least 1 minute per power level for each power on your list.

### Powercasting Ability
As a musician, you use your Charisma whenever a power refers to your powercasting ability. In addition, you use your
Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

__Power save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

__Power attack modifier__ = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
