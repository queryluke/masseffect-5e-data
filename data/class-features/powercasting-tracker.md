### Preparing and casting powers
The Tracker table shows how many tech points you have to cast your powers of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these
Tracker powers, you must expend a number of tech points equal to the powerâ€™s level or higher. You regain all expended
tech points when you finish a long rest.

You are limited in the number of tech points you can spend to cast a power as indicated in the Tech Point Limit column
of the Tracker table.

For example, a 9th-level Tracker can cast powers for 1 or 2 tech points.

You prepare the list of Tracker powers that are available for you to cast, choosing from the Tracker power list. When
you do so, choose a number of Tracker powers equal to your powercasting modifier + half your Tracker level (minimum of one power).

You may prepare the advanced version of a power for the cost of 2 regular versions. Whenever you cast the power, you
cast the advanced version of it. You may only prepare one advanced version for each power.

For example, if you are a 9th-level Tracker with a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared powers can be one of the following:

- seven regular powers
- one advanced power and five regular powers,
- two advanced powers and three regular powers,
- three advanced powers and one regular power

<br>

You can also change your list of prepared powers when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of Tracker powers
requires time spent to program them into your omni-tool: at least 1 minute per power level for each power on your list.

### Powercasting Ability

Trackers use a modified omni-tool with certain pre-programmed powers. The use and maintenance is a rather simple
concept, and it can be used in various ways. As a tracker, you select an ability from Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma.
You use this ability score whenever a power refers to your powercasting ability. In addition, you use the modifier of
that score when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

__Power save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your selected ability modifier

__Power attack modifier__ = your proficiency bonus + your selected ability modifier
