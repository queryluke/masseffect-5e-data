At 3rd level, you can use your cunning action to whisper a short prayer to a god of your choosing. Chose one of the following effects:

__Kalahira__: The Goddess of Oceans hears your prayer and staves off death from an ally. If there's an ally nearby currently dying within <me-distance length="10" />, you stabilize them automatically.

__Arashu__: The Goddess of Protection hears your prayer and helps prevent damage to an ally of yours. When you say this prayer, choose one ally. Until the end of their next turn, the first attack roll each turn against them has disadvantage.

__Amonkira__: The Lord of Hunters hears your prayer, and guides your shots to hit their mark with deadly accuracy. When you score a critical hit during the turn you spoke this prayer, you add your level to the damage of any critical hits you make.
