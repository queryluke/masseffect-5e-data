At 18th level, your raw biotic potence interfaces perfectly with your augments, granting them new abilities. This only applies to your Main Augment.

__Primal Weaponry__: Your weapon deals an additional 1d8 necrotic damage. If your weapon is melee, it gains a reach of <me-distance length="5" />. This can stack with the Reach property you can give it. If your weapon is ranged, double its range.

__Primal Processor__: You gain proficiency in Intelligence and Charisma Saving throws, and you become resistant to Psychic damage. Any creature who causes you Psychic damage takes Psychic damage equal to one roll of your Exploit die.

__Primal Plating__: You become resistant to Necrotic, Radiant and Force damage. When you are hit by a biotic power, roll a 1d20. On a roll of 16 or higher, you regain one power slot.
