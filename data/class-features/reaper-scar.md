You become Indoctrinated 1. You can never be immune to the Indoctrinated condition caused by this subclass. However, as your
Indoctrination level goes up, you become more attuned to your abilities. You gain a bonus to your attack,
damage and healing rolls equal to the level of your Indoctrinated condition. In addition, you are
immune to the negative effects of the Indoctrinated condition.
