You've also gotten the knack for triggering traps with more control on when they go off and how.

At 3rd level, any Grenade, Mine or explosive object (GM's discretion) within short range of your equipped ranged
weapon that is not being carried by a creature, you may use a Bonus Action or Attack to detonate the
object with an increased explosion radius of <me-distance length="5" />. If you are currently hidden this turn,
you will remain hidden with your current Stealth result without needing to roll a new Stealth check.

Remote Detonation does not cost heat to use, however your equipped weapon's heat must be higher than 0.
