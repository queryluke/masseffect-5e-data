With months upon months of meditation, the Cardinal's own biotics manifest into their own set of unique blades
that come from free hands, like omni-weapons do.

At 3rd level, you gain the "Cardinal Blades", a set of unique blades emitted from your own biotic energy, coming from
your specially crafted gauntlets that have been passed down to you from within your clan, from generation to generation.

#### Cardinal Blades

__Melee Weapon__

- _Damage_: 1d10 Slashing
- _Range_: <me-distance length="5" />
- _Properties_: Versatile (2d6), Finesse, Special

On a killing blow with this weapon, you gain 1 Focus Point. You cannot raise your Focus Points past your current
maximum with this weapon. Attacks with this weapon will add your current Focus Points to this melee weapon's
attack and damage rolls.

Like Omni-weapons, drawing one/them is a free action. Having this weapon equipped does not require a weapon slot.
