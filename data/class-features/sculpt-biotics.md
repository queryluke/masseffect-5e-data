Starting at 2nd level, You can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your biotic powers. When you cast a biotic power that
affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1+the power's level. The chosen creatures
automatically succeed on their saving throws against the power, and they take no damage if they would normally take half
damage on a successful save.
