Starting at 5th level, your command over your beast has been improved to basic muscle memory.

- When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make two Attacks as part of the Attack action. When you take
the attack action, you may instead give up one or both attacks to command your beast to attack that many times instead.

- When you cast a power with a casting time of an action, or command your beast to do so, the creature that did not
cast may make one weapon attack afterwards. (No further action required from you).
