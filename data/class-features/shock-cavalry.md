Disrupting the frontlines is your best tactic.

If you or your beast hit a creature with an attack after moving at least <me-distance length="20" />, and the one
hitting the target is within <me-distance length="15" /> of the target, that creature must then make a Wisdom saving
throw against your Powercasting saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. The creature can retry the saving
throw at the end of each of his turns, ending the effect on a success.
