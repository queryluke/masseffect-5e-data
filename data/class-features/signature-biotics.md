class: adept
level: 20

When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful powers and can cast them with little effort. Choose
two 1st or 2nd-level biotic powers you know as your signature biotics. You can cast each of them once at 2nd level without
expending a power slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either power at 3rd-level or higher, you must expend a power slot as normal.
