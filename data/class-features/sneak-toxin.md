At 3rd level, you can change your sneak attack damage poison damage. Additionally, when you do so, you can forego a
number of Sneak Attack Dice to apply one Toxin to your target. When you gain this class feature, you learn one
Toxin from the Toxin list.

At 9th, 13th and 18th level, you learn a new Toxin from the list.
