At {{ level }} level, you gain the ability to clone spell effects onto your omni-tool.

Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can use your
reaction to force the creature to make a saving throw with its spellcasting ability modifier. The DC equals your spell
save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell's effect on you and you copy a temporary version of the spell onto
your omni-tool if it is at least 1st level and of a level you can cast (it does not have to be a tech spell). For the
next 8 hours, you know the spell and can cast it using your tech points. The creature can't cast that spell until the
8 hours have passed.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
