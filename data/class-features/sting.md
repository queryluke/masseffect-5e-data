      Whenever you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack on your turn, you may take the Hide action as a free action.

The ways of the Night Stalkers teach one to keep hidden at all times, never to be caught unawares, taking cover at
lightning speed after shooting to keep the prey guessing on where that last shot came from.

At 9th level, you may perform the Hide action as a free action after successfully hitting a creature with a ranged
weapon attack during your turn. You may use this ability three times per long rest.
