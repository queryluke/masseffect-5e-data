At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within
range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
