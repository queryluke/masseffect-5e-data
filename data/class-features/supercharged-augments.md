At 18th level, your augments improve due to the symbiosis between your implants and your body. This only applies to your Main Augment.

__Supercharged Weaponry__: Your weapons deal an additional 1d8 thunder damage. If your weapon is melee, it deals the
same damage to shields that it would deal to health (efectively dealing the same damage to both shields and health). If your weapon is ranged, it bypasses shields.

__Supercharged Processors__: Your walking speed increases by <me-distance length="15" />. You gain expertise in one other skill of your choice, and you cannot become Confused or Stunned.

__Supercharged Plating__: You become resistant to Lightning damage. Whenever an enemy hits you in melee range, it takes Lightning damage equal to one roll of your Exploit Die + your Experiment level.
