        Create a Trauma Suite on up to four willing allies within <me-distance length="75" /> of you for 1 minute.
        <br><br>
        While all four of your Trauma Suites are deployed, your allies heal for 1d8 more damage whenever they heal hit points.
        <br><br>
        You can cast First Aid on that ally as a Bonus Action instead of a normal action. You can affect all creatures currently benefiting from Trauma Suite at the same time at no additional action or power slot cost.
        <br><br>
        When you use your Transfusion ability, if you need to use your health to power that feature, you have resistance to the damage it deals to your health.
        <br><br>
        When an ally wearing a Trauma Suite takes damage, the ally can decide to pass on half of the damage they took to another ally wearing a Trauma Suite. The ally takes that damage, and cannot diminish it with Barrier.
        <br><br>
        If an ally affected by Trauma Suite ally reaches zero hit points, the Trauma Suite shuts off and the ally is stabilized.
