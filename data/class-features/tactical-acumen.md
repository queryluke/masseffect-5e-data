At 10th level, when an enemy within <me-distance length="50" /> of you dies, your haptic feedback restores some
power to you omni-tool, granting you 1 Tech Point that must be spent before the end of your next turn. This ability
triggers as many times as enemies die before your next turn, but all points not spent are lost at the end of your next turn.
