In addition to the standard defensive VI, you've augmented your Tech Armor to run different VI packages.
At 7th level, when you activate
tech armor, you can choose to run a different VI package instead. When you activate an alternate package, you
do not gain hit points, instead, you and any friendly creature within <me-distance length="30" /> of you gain
the effect of the package for 1 hour. You may only have one tech armor active at once.
