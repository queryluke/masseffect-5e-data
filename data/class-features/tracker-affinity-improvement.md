#### Tracker Affinity Improvement Table

Landscape|Bonus
---|---
Arctic|You gain cold resistance, and have advantage on Strength saving throws against being frozen.
Badlands|When making Wisdom (Survival) checks to track something, you add double your proficiency bonus to the check, even if you're not proficient.
Jungle|	You can take the hide action as a bonus action, and gain advantage on Dexterity(Stealth) Checks when hiding in foliage.
Mountains|	Your climbing speed now equals your movement speed (or is increased by 4m instead of 2m if you already had one.), and when falling, you take less damage equal to 5x your Tracker level.
Low Gravity|If you jump in Low Gravity, you have a flying speed of 6m before you start falling. If you are above an enemy when you fall, your first melee attack against that creature has advantage.
Plains|Your walking speed increases by a further 4m, and you can take the Dash action as a bonus action.
Swamps|Any creature that starts its turn within 6m of you gains a swimming speed equal to yours, as your adept swimming creates a slipstream for allies to move through more easily
Urban|You do not provoke attacks of opportunity when moving out of range of enemies.
Volcanic|You gain fire resistance, and can move through areas of burning fire without taking damage.
