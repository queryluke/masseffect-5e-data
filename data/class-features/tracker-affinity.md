Every tracker has an area of expertise when it comes to tracking prey. Starting at level 1, you gain features relating
to a particular area that your tracker has spent a lot of time in, and has improved capabilities gained from that
terrain or while traveling in that terrain. Choose Arctic, Badlands, Desert, Jungle, Low-Gravity, Plains, Urban or Volcanic.

Choose one of the available landscapes, gaining any bonuses from the selected affinity.

The affinity upgrades at level 7. At level 11, you may choose a second one, and at 14th level the second affinity upgrades.

Where possible, these bonuses apply to your Beast as well.
