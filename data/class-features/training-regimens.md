No one ever stops learning, least of all the pets in the employ of a skilled Tracker.

Starting at 2nd level, your pet is able to learn two training regimens, choosing from the list below.

If a regimen has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the regimen at the same time that you
meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

You gain 2 training regimens at level 2, gaining another at levels 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 and 19.

When you gain a level in the Tracker class, you may replace one of the regimen you've taught your pet with another.
