At 3rd level, you can now target your Charge cantrip at an ally. When you do so, your ally does not take the
damage of the charge. Instead, if you have a barrier active and with 2 or more ticks, you can chose to
transfer one tick to your ally. This effect does not allow your ally to use the Tactical Barrier and
Heavy Barrier class features, unless they themselves have those features.
