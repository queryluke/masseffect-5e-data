At 10th level, when you cast First Aid, you can drain 2Xd8 points of your shields to improve the healing of First
aid by Xd8. If you don't have shield points, you can inflict this damage to your health instead, as you force your
armor to overheat to fuel this boost. X can be a number between 1 and your maximum proficiency modifier.
