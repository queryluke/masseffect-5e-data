At level 20, your partnership and improvement of both your own skills and your Beast's skills has reached its apex.
Based on your Beast choice, it gains the following benefits:

__Brute.__ Its Strength and Constitution scores are improved by 4 each, as well as their score maximums.

__All-Round.__ Leading the pack, your beast is exceptionally skilled at charging into the fray. When it moves for the first time after rolling initiative, it may take a number of allies with it. They may move up to their movement speed in the same direction as the beast, but may stop their movement at any time along the path.

__Flier.__ Your Beast has become exceptionally skilled at its abilities. Choose two skills. Whenever your Beast makes a check with that skill, it may choose to count any roll below a 10 into a 10.

__Synthetic.__ Putting the final touches on a masterpiece like this is always tough, especially with so much choice. Choose two Regimen from the list, and add them to your list of known Regimen. At the end of a long rest, you may exchange up to 3 Regimen for other Regimen. You must still fulfill the requirements for the new Regimen after giving up the old ones.
