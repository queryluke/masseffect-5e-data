At 18th level, you've mastered using your unstable barrier in both defense and offense. Whenever you make a successful
attack roll on an enemy within <me-distance length="5" /> of you, you may spend one barrier tick to add your barrier's
damage reduction roll (2d8) as bonus Force damage. On a critical hit, this force damage dice also doubles.
