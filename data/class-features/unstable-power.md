At 10th level, the energies within you are becoming harder and harder to contain as your power grows. Whenever you take
damage or fail a saving throw while your barrier is active, you may choose to roll on the Biotic Wrath table and
immediately produce the new effect, this will replace your current Biotic Wrath effect.
