At 3rd level, you gain proficiency and expertise in the Poisoner's Kit. If you are already proficient in the Poisoner's
Kit, gain Expertise for it and proficiency in another kit of your choice. If you have both, you gain proficiency and
expertise on another kit of your choice. Additionally, you cannot poison yourself by accident when using the poisoner's kit.

When you deal Poison damage, ignore resistance to Poison Damage. Treat Immunity to Poison damage as Resistance to Poison damage.
