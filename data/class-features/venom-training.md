You are trained in the Cabal's signature style of biotics. When you gain this feature at 3rd level, you integrate a
special melee weapon onto your armor: the Cabal Venom Gauntlets. These weapons have the Special and Finesse tags, and
deal 1d8 Poison damage on a hit. When you wear Venom Gauntlets, you wear them as a pair, and can thus make an extra
attack as a bonus action when you use your action to make an attack with them.
