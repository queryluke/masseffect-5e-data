At 14th level, you learn how to aim for your target's vitals when you cast a power. When you cast a power and chose
to reduce it's damage die size to make it bypass shields, the power crits on a roll of 19 or 20. You cannot use
this feature in tandem with Piercing Power: you must chose which feature to use before you roll your power attack roll.
