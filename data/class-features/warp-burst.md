At 6th level, while your gun still has Biotic Bullets in it's current magazine, it is treated as having the Double Tap
property, as you use your biotics to help the gun vent heat and cycle it's action more seamlessly.

In addition, whenever you cast a vanguard biotic power from a power slot, you can use your bonus action to
make a single attack against a target you can see.
