name: Sneak Attack
---
Beginning at {{ level }} level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can 
deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must 
be made with a melee or ranged weapon.

You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 2m of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, 
and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the 
Infiltrator table.
