At {{ level }} level, you learn to handle yourself in close combat. Making a ranged attack roll while within 2m of an enemy doesn't impose disadvantage on your roll.

In addition, if you hit a creature within 2m of you with a ranged attack on your turn, that creature can't take reactions until the end of this turn.
