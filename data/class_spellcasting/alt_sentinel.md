### Cantrips
You know two cantrips of your choice from the sentinel spell list. You learn additional sentinel cantrips of your choice
at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Sentinel table.

### Spell Slots for Biotics
The Sentinel table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of
your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your _biotic_ sentinel spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell
slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell lance, you must spend
one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.

### Preparing and casting spells
The Sentinel table shows how many tech points you have to cast your _tech_ spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these
spells, you must expend a number of tech points equal to the spellâ€™s level or higher. You regain all
expended tech points when you finish a long rest.

### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
At 1st level, you know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the sentinel spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Sentinel table shows when you learn more sentinel spells of your choice of 1st level
and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your
level. When you reach 5th level, for example, you learn a new sentinel spell, which can be 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sentinel spells you know and learn an advanced
version of it. You select one of the advancement options listed in the spell description. Whenever you cast the spell,
you cast the advanced version of it. You can only learn one advancement for each spell.

### Spellcasting Ability

Sentinels use the L5q biotic implant and a modified Omni-tool. When casting _Biotic_ spells, Wisdom is your spellcasting 
ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a biotic spell you cast and when 
making an attack roll with one. When casting _Tech_ powers, Intelligence is your spellcasting ability. In addition, you 
use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

__Spell save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your (Wisdom or Intelligence) modifier

__Spell attack modifier__ = your proficiency bonus + your (Wisdom or Intelligence) modifier
