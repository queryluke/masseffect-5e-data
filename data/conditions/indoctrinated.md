If your campaign is set during any part of the Reaper invasion, it's likely you'll need some 
<a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Indoctrination" target="_blank">indoctrination</a> effects.
While we encourage you to riff on these ideas or make up your own, here is a baseline for using indoctrination in your
campaign.

Spending time in the presence of a creature or object that can cause indoctrination (namely, Reaper technology) can 
lead to a special condition called indoctrination. Indoctrination is measured in six levels. For each 24 hour 
period a creature spends within the presence of an indoctrinating source, the creature must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. 
On a failed save, the creature suffers one level of indoctrination. If an already indoctrinated creature spends another 
24 hour period within the presence of Reaper technology, the DC of the saving throw increases as described below.

Level | Next Wisdom DC | Effect
--- | --- | ---
1 | 12 | You have difficulty sleeping and constantly have dreams of inky black and oily shadows. To gain the benefits of a long rest takes an additional 4 hours.
2 | 14 | You begin showings signs of paranoia, having feelings of being watched. You have disadvantage on all your Charisma-based skill checks.
3 | 16 | You have extreme paranoia. You have disadvantage on all of your Wisdom- and Intelligence-based skill checks.
4 | 18 | You begin to hear voices that issue simple commands. If you do not immediately follow the command, you take 11 (2d10) psychic damage. This damage bypasses shields.
5 | 20 | The voices in your head speak to you often and you begin to agree with what they're saying. You are considered charmed.
6 | - | You become a Reaper thrall and lose all control of your character (You are effectively dead).

### Reducing Indoctrination Levels
Every long rest that a creature spends outside of the range of an indoctrinating source, it can make a new 
Wisdom saving throw (DC based on its current indoctrination level). On a success, reduce its indoctrination level by 1.

Note: Synthetic creatures are immune to indoctrination.

### Reaper Tech

Usually, indoctrination happens when another creature (such as a reaper, thorian, or leviathan) is actively trying to 
indoctrinate one or many creatures. An exception to this is Reaper technology (i.e., reaper parts or devices salvaged from 
battle or space). Reaper technology can passively indoctrinate creatures that are merely in the technology's presence. 
Determining if a creature is within the presence of a piece of Reaper technology is based on the technology's size. 
The larger the object, the farther the range.

#### Distance of Indoctrination
Size of tech | Range
--- | ---
Tiny | 10 meters
Small | 25 meters
Medium | 100 meters
Large | 1 kilometer (~ 1/2 a mile)
Huge | 10 kilometers (~ 6 miles)
Gargantuan |  100 kilometers (~ 60 miles)
