When you’re within <me-distance length="5" /> of a creature on your turn, you can expend one Command die and
switch places with that creature, provided you spend at least <me-distance length="5" /> of movement and the creature
is willing and isn’t incapacitated. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.

Roll the Command die. Until the start of your next turn, you or the other creature (your choice) gains a bonus to AC equal to the number rolled.
