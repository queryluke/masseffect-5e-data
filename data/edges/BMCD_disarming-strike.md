      When an ally hits a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one Command die to command them to attempt to
      disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it’s holding. You add the Command die to the
      attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save,
      it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.
