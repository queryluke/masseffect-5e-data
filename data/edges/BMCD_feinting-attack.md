      You can expend one Command die and use a bonus action on your turn to command an ally to feint, choosing one creature
      within <me-distance length="5" /> of the ally as their target. Your ally has advantage on its next attack roll
      against that creature this turn. If that attack hits, add the Command die to the attack’s damage roll.
