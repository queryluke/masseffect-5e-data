      When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one Command die to maneuver one of your comrades into a
      more advantageous position. You add the Command die to the attack’s damage roll, and you choose a friendly
      creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without
      provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.
