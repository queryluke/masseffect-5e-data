      When an ally hits a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one Command die to have it attempt to drive the
      target back. You add the Command die to the attack’s damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make
      a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to <me-distance length="15" /> away from it.
