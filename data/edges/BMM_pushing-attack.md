When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend one barrier tick to attempt to drive the target back. You
add the barrier tick to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a
Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to <me-distance length="20" /> away from you.
