When you cast a power that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from
the power's full force. To do so, you spend 1 barrier tick and choose a number of those creatures up to your
powercasting ability modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the power.
