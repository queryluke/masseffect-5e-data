You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each sentient creature (Intelligence 4 more) that can
hear you must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature
fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.

You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened, immediately ending the condition.

Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This
indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed.
The indifference lasts at least 1 minute, unless the GM rules otherwise.

You may use this benefit once per long rest.
