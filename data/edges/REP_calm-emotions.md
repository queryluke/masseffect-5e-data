      Each sentient creature that can hear you must make on a DC {{ dc }} CHA saving
      throw; creatures can choose to fail automatically. For each failure, choose to end the charmed or frightened condition
      or make the creature indifferent about creatures of your choice (the indifference lasts 1 minute and ends if the
      target is attacked or harmed or witnesses its allies being attacked or harmed).

You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each sentient creature (Intelligence 4 more) that can
hear you must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature
fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.

You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened, immediately ending the condition.

Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This
indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed or if it witnesses any of its allies being harmed.
The indifference lasts at least 1 minute, unless the GM rules otherwise.

You may use this benefit once per long rest.
