    shortDesc: >-
      A sentient creature that can see or hear you must succeed on a DC {{ dc }} WIS saving throw or be charmed by you for the next
      hour. If you or your allies are fighting the creature, it has advantage of this save. While charmed, the creature
      does its best to obey your commands. Whenever it takes damage, it makes a new saving throw.
---
You attempt to compel a sentient creature (Intelligence of 4 or more) that you can see and that can hear you.
It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the next hour. If you or creatures that are friendly
to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.

While the creature is charmed, you can issue commands to it while you are conscious (no action required), which it
does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature,"
"Run over there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction
from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, it is no longer charmed.

You may use this benefit once per long rest.
