      For the next hour, whenever a sentient creature comes within <me-distance length="60" abbr /> of you, it must
      succeed on a DC {{ dc }} WIS saving throw or become frightened of you. The creature remains frightened while it can see
      you or is within <me-distance length="60" /> of you. While frightened by you, the creature must use its
      movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can't see you. If the creature moves more than
      <me-distance length="60" /> from you and can't see you, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature
      becomes frightened again if it regains sight of you or moves within <me-distance length="60" /> of you.

Your presence can cause even the most battle hardened veterans to quiver. For the next hour when a sentient
creature (Intelligence 4 or more) can see you and comes within <me-distance length="60" /> of you, the creature must
succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see you or is
within <me-distance length="60" /> of you. While frightened by you, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe
spot from which it can't see you. If the creature moves more than <me-distance length="60" /> from you and can't see you, the creature
is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of you or moves within
<me-distance length="60" /> of you.
