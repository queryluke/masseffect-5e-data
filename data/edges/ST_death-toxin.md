_Prerequisite: 18th level Infiltrator, Vulnerability Toxin_

You can chose to forego all of your sneak attack dice. The DC of this poison is 10, and the opponent rolls a d20. If it rolls 10 or under, it is reduced to -1 hit points.

A creature targeted by this toxin is then immune to it's effects for the next 24 hours. You can only use this Toxin a number of times per long rest equal to your Intelligence modifier.
