__Prerequisite: 11th-level, Fast Retreat__

Your beast has mastered the art of rushing down enemies. It no longer provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures it attacks. In addition, if you command your beast to attack with both your attacks, it can make an additional attack as part of that command, as long as the last attack is against a different creature than the first two attacks.
