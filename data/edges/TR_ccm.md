__Prerequisite: 5th-level__

You equip your beast with a small foldable exhaust that is capable of sending out a wide blast of damaging blasts,
such as flames, liquid nitrogen or bursts of electricity. Select one of the following damage types; Fire, Cold,
Electric, Acid, Radiant, Thunder. Then check the table below. As an action, you can command your beast to activate the
C.C.M. it has. The damage, area of effect and any secondary effects are described in the table on the next page.
For Acid, a creature only takes damage from 1 of the acid projectiles.

Your beast can use the C.C.M. three times, after which it must take a long rest to regain its uses. The DC for this ability equals your Powersave DC.
