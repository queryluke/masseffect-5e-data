__Prerequisite: Organic Beasts only__

Your creature was exposed to element zero during its conception, and has developed biotic nodes inside it,
allowing it to use biotics to a limited degree.

Choose 2 biotic cantrips and 2 biotic powers. Your beast gains the abilty to cast the cantrips at will. To cast the
leveled powers, it must use a power slot it has a available. When taking this Regimen, it gains 2 1st-level power slots.
It must complete a long rest before it can cast the leveled powers again.

The Beast's Wisdom is used as the spellcasting modifier for attack rolls and saving throws.

Instead of a second power, you may choose an advancement for the one spell instead.
