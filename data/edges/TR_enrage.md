__Prerequisite: 5th-level, Organic Beast__

Your beast has learned to unleash its inner....beast. As a bonus action your Beast can begin Raging (this does not
stop you from commanding it to attack) if your beast is not wearing Heavy Armor. While raging, it cannot cast powers
or concentrate them if it is able to do so normally. Furthermore, it gains the following benefits:

- It has resistance against Piercing, Slashing and Bludgeoning damage.
- It deals an additional 3 damage per hit. This damage increases to 4 at level 9, 5 at level 13, and 6 at level 17
- It has advantage on Strength checks and saving throws.

A beast can rage 3 times. It regains all uses of Enrage on a long rest.
