Your beast becomes familiar with the sensation and becomes trained in carrying guns into the field, and becomes equipped
with a gun mount. A targeting VI takes care of the firing of the weapon (+4 to hit).

On a long rest, you are able to change the mounted gun, if you have the new weapon at the ready. The old weapon can be
safely dismounted with a DC 13 Weaponsmith's Bench check. On a fail, the removed weapon breaks, and becomes unusable.

If an allied character is within 2m of the beast it can also manually use the weapon using their own stats.
