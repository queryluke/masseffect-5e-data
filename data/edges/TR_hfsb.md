__Prerequisite: 11th-level, Synthetic Beast, Fine Motor Control Servos__

Your beast gains a new natural weapon that it can use to attack.

Sawblade: To hit Str + PB, 3d6 slashing damage.

The damage of this attack cannot be reduced by slashing resistance. The first time this attack hits an organic creature, the target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15). On a fail, the target takes an additional 3d6 damage at the start of its next turn from bleeding. A creature can only suffer this damage once per round.
