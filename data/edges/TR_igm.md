__Prerequisite: 11th-level, Your beast has 16 Strength__

Improve the firepower of your beast by showing the world the power of two guns.

You are now able to mount a second gun on your mount. When firing, both these guns fire at once in one attack if the range allows it. The range of these weapons is the same as the range of the weapon with the shorter range. On hit, deal damage equal to the weapons' combined hit dice.

The V.I. of the mount has improved, making the to hit bonus +6

Alternatively, you may mount a Heavy Weapon on your beast. If you command it to use this heavy weapon, it costs you both your Attacks. Otherwise, it fires the weapon the same way
