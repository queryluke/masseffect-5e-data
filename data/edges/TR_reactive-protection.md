__Prerequisite: 11th-level, Reactive Fangs__

Your beast's reactive fangs are powerful, but volatile. With this, your beast either uses a special temporary omni-shield or biotic barrier to protect itself.
When your beast detonates a Primed target, it is unaffected by the detonation, and does not take any damage from it.
