__Prerequisite: 7th-level, Gun Mount__


You have connected to the VI controlling the weapon on your beast. If you have not moved yet this turn, you can give up your movement to take manual control of the gun on your mount's back. You gain the ability to see through a camera on the gun, and can control and fire it using your omni-tool. While you look through your beast's weapon, you can use your Attack action to fire the weapon. Instead of the base modifier, you use your power attack modifier to make weapon attacks instead.

While doing so, your visual focus is completely on looking through the camera, and thus you are blinded as long as you keep looking through the camera.
