__Prerequisite: Synthetic Beast__

Your beast has a hidden compartment underneath some of its armor plating, which when opened reveals a six-burner stove
and a small counter. While in this configuration, your beast cannot move or take any actions besides using a free action
to fold up the stove. You have advantage on ability checks with Cook's Utensils while using them with your beast in this configuration.
