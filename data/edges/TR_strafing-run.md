__Prerequisite: Gun Mount, Flier only, must have a weapon that can take the Burst Fire action.__

Your beast has become trained in a particular facet of combat. Choose 1 ability score. Your beast becomes proficient
in the saving throw of that score, allowing it to add its proficiency bonus to those saving throws with that ability score.

As your beast flies over the battlefield, it can use the gun on its back to shower the area it flies over in gunfire.
If your beast flies at least 8m in a straight line, you can use an action to command it to make a special Strafing Run
attack. All creatures standing in the 8m line must succeed a Dexterity saving throw (DC 13) or take the damage of the
weapon. Like Burst Fire, this action costs 3 heat.

You can increase the length of the line if your beast continues flying in the same direction. For every 2m beyond the
original length, the gun uses 1 more heat.

If you take the Improved Gun Mount regimen at level 11, the width of this line increases to 4m (your choice on what side).
