__Prerequisite: Synthetic Beast only__

You install special programs into your beast, allowing them to cast tech powers.

Choose two tech powers from the Engineer power list. Your beast gains 3 power slots, which it uses to cast the powers.
Once used, the power slots recharge on a long rest. Instead of choosing a second power, you may choose to advance one power.

The beast's Intelligence is used as the powercasting modifier for the attack rolls and powersave DC's.
