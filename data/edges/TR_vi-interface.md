__Prerequisite: Synthetic Beast__

You install a VI interface on your synthetic beast, which improves its processing speed and communicative abilities.
When you select this Regimen, your beast's Intelligence increases by 2. Furthermore, it becomes capable of speech
and is able to relay messages through this vocal system.

With this interface, your synthetic beast also becomes able to receive A.I. packets (See Andromeda, The After Story Chapter X, Special Equipment).
