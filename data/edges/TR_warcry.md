Your beast lets out a loud roar, bark, squawk, yell or screech, attempting to intimidate and frighten creatures
around it. All hostile creatures that can hear and see the beast must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8+PB +Con mod).
On a failed saving throw, they are frightened of the beast for 1 minute. At the end of the creatures' turns, they may
reroll the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

Once a creatures succeeds on this save, they are not frightened and become immune to Warcry for 24 hours.
