Geth were designed as lethal weapons and can activate subroutines to enhance their lethality.

As an action, you can activate Assault Hunter Mode, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:

- Your movement speed increases by 2 meters.
- Whenever you make a weapon attack, gain a +1 bonus to the roll.
- While hunter mode is active, you can attack one additional time whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

You may use this feat once per long rest.
