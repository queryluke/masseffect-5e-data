Your innate biotics are extensions of your limbs, and you no longer think twice about them,
and can utilize them almost without thinking.

Whenever you cast one of the powers you selected for your Innate Biotics trait, you may use
your reaction to sustain the power for its full duration without the need for concentration
(you may cast a second Concentration power while this one is active, and you do not need to make
Constitution saving throws to maintain it when you suffer damage).

Once you use this feat, you must finish a long rest before you may use it again.
