Squeezing the life out of an enemy is just as satisfying as taking them down at range.

- When a creature attempts to break a grapple with you and succeeds, you can use your reaction to
force the creature to roll again. The creature must use the second result.
- When a creature provokes an opportunity attack from you, you may instead use your reaction to
attempt to grapple the creature.
- At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature
grappled by you (no action required).
- Your movement is not halved when grappling a creature your size or smaller.
