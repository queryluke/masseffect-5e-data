You are filled with an immense determination that can turn events in your favor.

- Increase one ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can do so with advantage.
Once you use this feat, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
