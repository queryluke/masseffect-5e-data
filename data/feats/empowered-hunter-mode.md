Geth were designed as lethal weapons and can activate subroutines to enhance their lethality.

As an action, you can activate Empowered Hunter Mode, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:

- Your movement speed increases by 2 meters.
- You gain a +1 bonus to power attack rolls and the DC of your powers increases by 1.
- Increase the die type by 1 (max d12) for any damage rolls of powers you cast.
If the die type is already d12, add +1 for each d12 rolled instead of increasing the die type.

Empowered Hunter Mode lasts 1 minute and you must finish a long rest before you can use this feat again.
