You mimic confidence, competence and an optimistic mindset, which you hope help you realize those qualities in
your real life. You gain the following benefits:

- Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- If you fail a saving throw or ability check, or miss with an attack roll, you spend a hit die to roll d4 and
add it to the total, possibly changing the outcome. Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you
finish a short or long rest.
- You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Performance) checks when trying to convince a creature you
can accomplish something without a problem.
