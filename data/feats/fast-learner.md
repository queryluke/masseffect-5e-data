You are extremely apt to learn new skills. You gain the following benefits:

- Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- If you spend at least 1 hour with a creature, you can learn from it a new proficiency. The interaction must be
peaceful and the creature must have the proficiency you are intending to learn. You can choose between the following:
one tool proficiency, one skill proficiency, or proficiency with one specific weapon. You retain the proficiency until
you decide to change it for another, using the same process. This is considered light activity.
