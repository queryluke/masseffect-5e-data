You've mastered two-weapon fighting with ranged weapons, gaining the following benefits:

- You can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.
- Any light, one-handed ranged weapon you wield gains the Hip Fire and Recoil property.
- When you take the Attack action and are holding a light ranged weapon in both hands, you may attack with both weapons
  simultaneously, making a single attack roll. On a hit, you apply you ability modifier to the attack roll once. The
  range of the attack is equal to the lower range of the two weapons being used.
