Youâ€™ve mastered the Krogan headbutt and can use it as a ramming attack.

- Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- The die type of your Thick Frontal Plate unarmed strike becomes a d10.
- When you take the Dash action on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike with your frontal
plate as a bonus action.
