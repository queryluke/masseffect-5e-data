Youâ€™ve trained in an ancient Elcor martial art which adds range and impact to your slow and sweeping strikes.
- Increase your Dexterity or Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach for it is 2 meters greater than normal.
- Your unarmed strike uses a d8 for damage.
- Whenever you roll a 1 on a damage die for a melee attack, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.
