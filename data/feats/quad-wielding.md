Like Blasto himself, you’ve trained in the art of quad-wielding.

- When you engage in two-weapon fighting with a ranged weapon that has not made an attack this turn,
you can simultaneously make an attack with a second ranged weapon you are wielding that has not made an attack this turn.
Make a single attack roll for both weapons, using the lower of the weapons’ ranges.
- At the end of your turn, if you are wielding a ranged weapon that has not made an attack this turn, you may use
your reaction to make an attack with that weapon.
