Your bite becomes a deadly weapon, and youâ€™ve trained to pierce vital points.

- Increase your Dexterity by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Whenever you take the Dash action on your turn, you may use your bonus action to make an attack
with your Bite.
- Whenever you hit an organic target with your bite attack, it continues to bleed, suffering 1d6 
damage at the start of each of its turns due to blood loss. A creature can staunch the wound by 
using its action to attempt a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. On a success, the bleeding stops.
