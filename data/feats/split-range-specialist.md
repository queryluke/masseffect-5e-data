You've trained extensively in weaving together ranged and melee attacks, gaining the following benefits:

- +1 Strength or Dexterity
- You can use two-weapon fighting even when the one-handed weapons you are wielding aren't light.
- You can engage in two-weapon fighting when wielding a two-handed ranged weapon if one of the attacks is a gun strike or made with an omni-tool weapon.
- You can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.
