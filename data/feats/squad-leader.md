You know just what to say in a tight situation.

As a bonus action, you can inspire all allies within earshot to instantly roll a hit die and regain that many hit
points. This does not expend a hit die from their pool. Allies immediately recover from the following
conditions: {charmed}, {frightened}, {incapacitated}, {paralyzed}, {poisoned}, {prone}, {restrained}, and {stunned}. You
may use this ability once per long rest.
