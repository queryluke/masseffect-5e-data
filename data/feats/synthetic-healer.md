Youâ€™ve practiced in repairing and patching synthetics, gaining the following benefits:

- You have advantage on Intelligence (Engineering) and Intelligence (Electronics) checks to
stabilize synthetic creatures.
- You can use your action to expend an omni-gel and create 10 charges of a fast-acting,
conductive Epoxy.
- As an action, you can spend one epoxy to tend to a synthetic creature and restore
1d6 + 4 hit points to it, plus additional hit points equal to the creature's level.
The creature can't regain hit points from this feat again until it finishes a short or long rest.
