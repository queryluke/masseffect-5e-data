You’ve practiced an effective maneuver to hit multiple enemies simultaneously, keeping them at bay.

- Increase your Dexterity by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- As an action, you can make a special Tentacle Blender attack. Each creature within a <me-distance length="5" adj /> radius
centered on you must make a Dexterity saving throw or suffer damage equal to the total damage of each melee weapon you
are wielding. The DC of the saving throw is equal to 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus.
- If you are wielding a ranged weapon when you make this attack, it is considered a melee weapon,
dealing damage equivalent to your gun strike.
- If you are not wielding a weapon in a tentacle, you use the damage of your tentacle’s unarmed strike.
