You become even more dangerous when you enter a blood rage and can delay death even longer. While your blood rage is
active you gain the following:

- At the start of your turn, if you have 0 temporary hit points, gain 5 temporary hit points. If you have at least
  1 temporary hit point, add 5 temporary hit points to your temporary hit points pool.
- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll equal to your proficiency bonus.
- As a bonus action, you can move up to your speed toward an enemy of your choice that you can see or hear. You
must end this move closer to the enemy than you started.
