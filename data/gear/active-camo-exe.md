The user's omni-tool diverts energy to coat their armor in color-adaptive hard light, using
data obtained from the suit's micro-sensors. While not making the wearer truly invisible, this adaptive camouflage helps
the user blend into any environment. Wisdom (Perception) checks made to see you have disadvantage and you have
advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. You can use an action toggle this effect off or on as a free action.
