Target an area within <me-distance length="25" />. Each creature within <me-distance length="10" /> of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw.
A creature takes lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The mark of this grenade determines its Save DC, damage, and cost.
