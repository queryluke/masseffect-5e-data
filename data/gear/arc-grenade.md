Target an area within <me-distance length="25" />. Each creature within <me-distance length="10" /> of the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw.
A creature takes 3d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

__At higher marks__: When you use this grenade at Mark II or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each mark above the first.
