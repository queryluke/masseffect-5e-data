Launch a Cain Trip Mine to a point you can see within <me-distance length="50" />. The mine affixes to a solid surface and projects
a beam <me-distance length="15" /> tripwire. When a creature or object passes through the tripwire, the mine detonates.

A creature can spot the mine with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception).

To disarm the mine, a creature must pass an Intelligence (Electronics) check. If the check fails, the mine detonates, and
the creature that made the check automatically fails its saving throw. Additionally, a successful ranged attack on the
mine (AC 10) will detonate it.

When the mine detonates, each creature within a <me-distance length="10" adj/>-radius sphere centred on the mine must
make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature suffers thunder damage (see below) on a failed save
or half as much damage on a successful one.

The mark of this mine determines the DC of its Intelligence (Electronics) check, damage, and credits.
