Launch a Cain Trip Mine to a point you can see within <me-distance length="50" />. The mine affixes to a solid surface and projects
a beam <me-distance length="15" /> tripwire. When a creature or object passes through the tripwire, the mine explodes. Any creature within a <me-distance length="5" />
sphere must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d12 thunder damage on a failed save or half as much
damage on a successful one.

Creatures need to pass a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the mine.

To disarm the mine, a creature must pass a DC 13 Intelligence (Electronics) check. Failing the hacking check causes
the mine to explode. The creature that made the hacking check has disadvantage on its saving throw.

A successful ranged attack on the mine (AC 10) will cause it to explode. Each creature within <me-distance length="5" /> of the mine takes 2d12 thunder damage.

__At higher marks__: When you use this mine at Mark II or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each mark above the first.
