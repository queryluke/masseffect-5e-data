While this program is Active, you can use a bonus action to re-route a third of your omni-tool's processing power to
your armor's mobility servos, dramatically increasing your speed. You double your walking speed, and any attack of
opportunity made against you is made at disadvantage. This effect lasts 10 minutes, and can only be activated once per
long rest.

(this re-route wasn't intended by any armor manufacturer, the recovery time allows the omni-tool to scan and repair
the abuse electronics within the armor.)
