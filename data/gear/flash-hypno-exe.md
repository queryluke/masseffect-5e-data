This program activates strobes in the user's visor/eyewear with 3 powerful charges. You can expend 1 charge as an
action to cast the 'Charm Person' power (save DC 13) on an organic creature within <me-distance length="25" /> of you, provided that you and the
target can see each other. Your omni-tool regains all expended charges after a long rest, provided that the program is
Active.
