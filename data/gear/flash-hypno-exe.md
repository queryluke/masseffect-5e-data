This program activates strobes in the user's visor/eyewear with 3 powerful charges. You can expend 1 charge as an
action to attempt to charm a sentient creature (Intelligence score of 4 or more) with which you have eye contact
within <me-distance length="30" />. It must make a DC 13 Charisma saving
throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is
charmed by you for 1 hour or until your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature
regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the effect ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.

Your omni-tool regains all expended charges after a long rest, provided that the program is Active.
