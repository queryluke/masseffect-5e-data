Target an area within <me-distance length="25" />. Each creature within <me-distance length="10" /> of the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw.
On a failed save, a creature is <me-condition id="blinded"/> until the end of your next turn.

__At higher marks__: When you use this grenade at Mark II or higher, the DC of the Constitution saving throw increases
by 1 for each mark above the first.
