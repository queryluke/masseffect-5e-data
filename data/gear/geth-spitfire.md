As an Attack, begin targeting, releasing a torrent of bullets in a 10-meter cone extending from your location and consuming 1 charge. The torrent of bullets continues as long as your are targeting. Creatures that enter the area for the first time on a turn or being their turn there must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d4 radiant damage. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage. At the start of your turn, you may choose to continue targeting, consuming another charge.
