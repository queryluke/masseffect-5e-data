A heavy weapon charge is a generic term that can refer to a missile, energy source, or
raw material. Heavy weapons require charges to be used. Generally, heavy weapon charges are not available to purchase
by the general public. They must be bought at your local black market dealer or obtained from a military connection.

__Use.__ Each heavy weapon has a maximum number of charges it can hold at one time. Loading new charges into a weapon
requires 1 heavy weapon charge and the Reload action.
