Target an area within <me-distance length="25" />. Each creature within <me-distance length="10" /> of the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw.
On a failed save, a creature takes 3d4 fire or half as much on a successful one. The area within a <me-distance length="10" adj /> radius, centered on the target
continues to burn for 1 minute.

A creature must also make the saving throw when it enters the burning space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

__At higher marks__: When you use this grenade at Mark II or higher, the damage increases by 1d4 for each mark above the first.
