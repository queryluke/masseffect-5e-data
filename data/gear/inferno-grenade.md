Target an area within 10m. Each creature within 4m of the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw.
On a failed save, a creature takes 3d4 fire or half as much on a successful one. The 4m area continues to burn for 1 minute.
A creature must also make the saving throw when it enters the burning space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

__At higher marks__: When you use this grenade at Mark II or higher, the damage increases by 1d4 for each mark above the first.
