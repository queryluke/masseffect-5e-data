Target an area within <me-distance length="25" />. Each creature within <me-distance length="10" /> of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw.
On a failed save, a creature suffers fire damage or half as much on a successful one. The area within a <me-distance length="10" adj /> radius, centered on the target
continues to burn for 1 minute.

A creature must also make the saving throw when it enters the burning space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

The mark of this grenade determines its Save DC, damage, and credits.
