Target an area within 10m. Each creature within 4m of the target must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw.
On a failed save, a creature is <me-condition id="lifted"/> until the end of your next turn.

__At higher marks__: When you use this grenade at Mark II or higher, the DC of the Strength saving throw increases
by 1 for each mark above the first.
