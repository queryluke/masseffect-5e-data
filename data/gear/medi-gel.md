>Medi-gel (medical gel) is an all-purpose medicinal salve combining an anaesthetic and clotting agent used by paramedics,
EMTs, and military personnel, produced by the Sirta Foundation. It heals various wounds and ailments, instantly sealing
injuries against infection and allowing for rapid healing by having the gel grip tight to flesh until subjected to a frequency
of ultrasound. It is sealable against liquids - most notably blood - as well as contaminants and gases.

__Use__. When you use this item, you or a willing, organic creature within <me-distance length="5" /> regains hit points equal to the medi-gel's potency.
