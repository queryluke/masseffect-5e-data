As an Attack, choose a creature within 60m that you can see and begin targeting. If you remain targeting until the start of your next turn, fire a missile at the target. Each creature within a 4m cube centered on the target must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save a creature takes 6d12 thunder damage or half as much on a successful one.
