Place a proximity mine within <me-distance length="5" />. On your turn, you may use a bonus action to arm or
disarm the mine, as long as you are within <me-distance length="500" /> of it. While armed, any creature that moves within
<me-distance length="5" /> of the mine detonates it. If you arm the mine while a creature is within <me-distance length="5" />
of it, it detonates immediately.

A creature can spot the mine with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception).

To disarm the mine, a creature must pass an Intelligence (Electronics) check. If the check fails, the mine detonates.
Additionally, a successful ranged attack on the mine (AC 10) will destroy the mine if is it is disarmed or detonate it
if it is armed.

When the mine detonates, each creature within a <me-distance length="5" adj/>-radius sphere centred on the mine must
suffers thunder damage (see below).

The mark of this mine determines the DC of its Intelligence (Electronics) check, damage, and credits.
