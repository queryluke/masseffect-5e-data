Your omni-tool is equipped with a highly experimental quantum device. You can spend a bonus action to designate
an open space within <me-distance length="150" />, and instantly teleport there.

You project one invisibly small molecule into that space, which is quantum entangled with a molecule in your armor.
Sending an energy current through the device will re-unite the molecules instantly, effectively teleporting you to your
designated location. The device is then offline until the end of your next long rest.
