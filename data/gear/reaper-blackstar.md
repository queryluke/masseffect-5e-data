As an Attack, choose a creature within 120m that you can see and begin targeting. If you remain targeting until the start of your next turn, fire a sub-atomic particle beam at the target, dealing 15d10 necrotic damage. This weapon counts as a Small Reaper Tech and can cause creatures to become indoctrinated.
