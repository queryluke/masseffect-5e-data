Launch a recon mine to a location of your choice within <me-distance length="25" />. It first sticks to the target 
location then scans enemies within a <me-distance length="25" /> cone, relaying tactical weak points about the enemy's 
armor and location. After your turn ends, any hostile creature that walks through the scanning cone loses 1 AC. 
Each creature can only be affected by this debuff once.

You may spend another action to detonate the mine. Each creature within <me-distance length="5" /> must make a 
DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d4 thunder damage, or half as much damage on a 
successful one.

Creatures need to pass a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the mine.

To disarm the mine, a creature must pass a DC 13 Intelligence (Electronics) check. Failing the hacking check causes
the mine to explode. The creature that made the hacking check has disadvantage on its saving throw.

A successful ranged attack on the mine (AC 10) will cause it to explode. Each creature within <me-distance length="5" />
of the mine takes 2d4 thunder damage.

__At higher marks__: When you use this mine at Mark II or higher, the size of the cone increases by 
<me-distance length="5" /> for each mark above the first.
