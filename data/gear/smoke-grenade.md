Target an area within <me-distance length="25" />. A cloud of thick smoke erupts out in a <me-distance length="10" adj/> 
radius from the target location. The cloud's area is heavily obscured. The cloud persists for 30 seconds. A moderate 
wind (11 to 20 miles per hour) can disperse the smoke after 1 round, and a strong wind (21 or more miles per hour) 
can do so immediately.

__At higher marks__: When you use this grenade at Mark II or higher, the radius increases by <me-distance length="5" />
for each mark above the first.
