While this program is Active, your omni-tool links up to your armor's gauntlets, scanners, and weapon systems. Roughly
a third of its processing power is diverted into calculating micro-corrections when you fire at a target, generating
minuscule magnetic fields to align your aim more correctly. You are considered proficient with Sniper Rifles while this
program is Active, and gain a +2 to damage rolls with such weapons.
