As an Attack, choose a <me-distance length="25" adj num-only />-by-<me-distance length="50" adj /> rectangle and begin 
targeting. If you remain targeting until the start of your next turn, call down an orbital strike at the target location.
Each creature within the rectangle must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d12 
thunder damage. On a success, a creature takes half damage.
