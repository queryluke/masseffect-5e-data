- __Mechanic:__ The aspect that affects the gameplay. A mod or armor set can have one or more mechanics.
- __Mod:__ An item, containing one or more mechanics, that can be installed when creating custom armor.
- __Set:__ One or more pieces of armor that must be worn together and provide mechanics when worn. Mechanics contained 
within sets are meant to be integrated, and not salvageable from the armor. In addition, armor sets are not intended to 
be upgraded with other mods.
