An asari game that has been translated into portable, virtual form. This complex game requires strategy and incisive thinking 
to command a small fleet to take your opponent's "homeworld." Some versions include "neural feedback" which 
delivers a mild shock to the player when they lose a piece, which serves to disincentive casually sacrificing pieces.
