As a bonus action, you choose a creature you can see within <me-distance length="90" />. For the next minute,
you deal an extra 1d6 damage to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack, and you have
advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check you make to find it. You can use this feature
3 times per long rest.
