Summon a holographic copy of yourself at a location within range. Until the spell ends, the decoy moves with you and
mimics your actions. You can use your action to dismiss the decoy. Each time a creature targets you with an attack
during the spell's duration, it must first make a Wisdom (Perception) check. On a failure, a creature attacks
the decoy. On a success, the creature ignores the decoy, attacks you, and no longer needs to pass the Wisdom check to
target you.
