You can manipulate light objects with a series of mass effect fields. When you cast this cantrip, you can try to move an
object that weighs up to 10 kgs (~20 pounds). If the object isn't being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to
10 meters in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell.

If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested
by that creature's Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 10
meters in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell.
