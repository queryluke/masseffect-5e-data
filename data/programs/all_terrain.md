You can spend a free action to flash forge hard light enhancements for your armor, such as climbing spikes
on your boots and gloves, and flexible fins on your boots. While running this program, climbing and swimming don't cost
you extra movement, and you gain a +5 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb or swim.
