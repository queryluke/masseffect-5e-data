Developed by technicians who wanted more protection while maintaining light armor, while this program is Active your
omni-tool generates a form-fitting nano-cloud of hard light atoms around you, invisible to the naked eye. This increases
the chances that an incoming bullet or attack will be turned aside by the nano-cloud, acting as an extra layer of protection.

The user gains +2 to AC while not wearing Medium or Heavy Armor, or using a Riot Shield. (Anything bulkier than Light
Armor throws off the cloud's bio-tracking, and renders it ineffective.)
