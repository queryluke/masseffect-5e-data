While this program is active, highly-synced, micro-holo projectors blur the user's visual image and electromagnetic
presence on non-IFF'd sensors. This causes attack rolls against the user to have disadvantage. If the user takes damage,
this property ceases to function until the start of their next turn (due to the projectors re-routing power and re-compensating).
This property is suppressed while the user is incapacitated, restrained, or otherwise unable to move.
