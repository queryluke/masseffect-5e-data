This program activates strobes in the user's visor/eyewear with 3 powerful charges. You can expend 1 charge as an
action to cast the 'Charm Person' spell (save DC 13) on an organic creature within 10m of you, provided that you and the
target can see each other. Your omni-tool regains all expended charges after a long rest, provided that the program is
Active.
