While this program is active, your omni-tool perfectly balances your adrenal, muscular, skeletal and cardio systems to
optimize physical power. Depending on what Mark program you have active, your Strength score increases to a certain amount.
This has no effect if your Strength score is already equal to or higher than that value. Many military groups equip
their combat-ready infantry with a version or Mark I or II, but more up-to-date versions of the program are incredibly
rare to find, the bleeding edge of military technology that only the best can afford.

Version | STR Score | Rarity
--- | --- | ---
Mark I | 19 | Uncommon
Mark II | 21 | Rare
Mark III | 23 | Rare
Mark IV | 26 | Spectre
Mark V | 29 | Spectre
