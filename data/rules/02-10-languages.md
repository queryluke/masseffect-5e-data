Languages are not a part of Mass Effect 5e. Our interpretation is that there is enough technology to translate languages
on the fly, making it seem that everyone is speaking the same common tongue. Even new discovered races can have their
languages mapped into a universal translator in a number of hours utilizing underlying linguistic morphisms and lexical
cues fed into a supercomputer. However, how you and your GM choose to handle ancient or alien languages is up to your party.
Your asari archaeologist might be an expert in ancient alien glyphs or you might lay a Krogan who is known for reciting
poetry in an old dialect. This type of flavor is encouraged, but this system does not codify any specific languages.
