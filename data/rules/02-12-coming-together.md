Most characters don’t work alone. Each character plays a role within a __party__, a group of operatives working together
for a common purpose. Teamwork and cooperation greatly improve your party’s chances to survive the many perils in the galaxy.
Talk to your fellow players and your GM to decide whether your characters know one another, how they met, and what sorts
of assignments the group might undertake.
