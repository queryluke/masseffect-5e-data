As your character goes on missions and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by experience
points. A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called
__gaining a level__.

### Class Features and Hit Dice

When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description.
Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one
score by 2. You can’t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character's proficiency bonus increases
at certain levels.

Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll,
and add the total to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry,
which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).

When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.
For example, if your 7th-level soldier has a Constitution score of 17, when he reaches 8th level, he increases his
Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then
increases by 8 (1 additional hit point for each level).

### XP and Proficiency Bonus Progression

The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance in levels from level 1 through level 20 and the
proficiency bonus for a character of that level. Consult the information in your character's class description to see
what other improvements you gain at each level.

### Tiers of Play

In the __first tier__ (levels 1–4), characters are effectively rookies. They are learning the features 
that define them as members of particular classes, including the major choices that flavor their class features.
The threats they face are relatively minor, usually dealing with street gangs, small crimes, or loose pyjaks.

In the __second tier__ (levels 5–10), characters come into their own. Operatives should start acquiring __uncommon__ level 
equipment, increasing their combat potential. These characters have become important members of their factions (if they have
one), facing organized crime syndicates like the Blue Suns, Eclipse, and Blood Pack, and deal with threats to small colonies 
and medium-sized corporations.

In the __third tier__ (levels 11–16), characters have reached a level of noteriety that sets them high above the ordinary 
populace and makes them special even among other operatives. This tier is equivalent to reaching N7 and would
be the tier at which Shepard started in Mass Effect 1. Operatives gain access to __rare__ quality weapons and armor and might 
begin crafting their own unique armor with capabilities that further their potential. These operatives often confront threats 
to whole cities, are conscripted my major corporations to protect valuable assets, and are sent unexplored and dangerous
planets. Additionally, within this tier, the party generally acquires their own personal starship which opens up
travel across the galaxy.

At the __fourth tier__ (levels 17–20), characters achieve the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic 
(or villainous) archetypes in their own right. They begin collecting __spectre__ level equipment, the very best the galaxy
can offer. The fate of the entire universe might hang in the balance during their adventures.
