Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature's physical and mental characteristics:

- __Strength__, measuring physical power
- __Dexterity__, measuring agility
- __Constitution__, measuring endurance
- __Intelligence__, measuring reasoning and memory
- __Wisdom__, measuring perception and insight
- __Charisma__, measuring force of personality

Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these
qualities - a creature's assets as well as weaknesses. The three main rolls of the game - the ability check, the saving throw,
and the attack roll - rely on the six ability scores. The [Introduction](/phb/intro#how-to-play) describes the basic
rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the
total to a target number.
