title: 'Ability Checks'

An ability check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The
GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance
of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.

For every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of
the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes
table shows the most common DCs.


### Typical Difficulty Classes
<ai-dialog title="Typical Difficulty Classes table" component="typical-difficulty-classes-table"></ai-dialog>

To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and
penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success -
the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the character or monster makes
no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.


### Contests
Sometimes one character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed to another's. This can occur when both of them are
trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a grenade that has fallen on the floor.

This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal - for example,
when a brute tries to force open a door that an operative is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is
determined by a special form of ability check, called a __contest__.

Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and
penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with
the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other
one from succeeding.

If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might
win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a grenade the floor, neither character grabs it.
In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an operative trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that
the door remains shut.


<h3>Skills <v-chip color="orange accent-2" text-color="black" class="v-chip--x-small">change</v-chip></h3>
Mass Effect 5e is a sci-fi setting, thus some of the fantasy skills (like religion and arcana) have been replaced with new
skills.

__Removed Skills__: _Animal Handling_, _Arcana_, _Nature_, _Religion_
\
__New Skills__: _Electronics_, _Engineering_, _Science_, _Vehicle Handling_

Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in.
A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual's proficiency in a skill demonstrates a
focus on that aspect. A character's starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster's
skill proficiencies appear in the monster's stat block.

For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character's attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or
to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth,
respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related
to sneaking and hiding.

The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. No skills are related to Constitution. See an
ability's description in the <nuxt-link to="/phb/appendix/skills">Appendix: Skills</nuxt-link> for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.

#### Strength
- Athletics

#### Dexterity
- Acrobatics
- Sleight of Hand
- Stealth
- Vehicle Handling

#### Intelligence
- Electronics
- Engineering
- History
- Investigation
- Science

#### Wisdom
- Insight
- Medicine
- Perception
- Survival

#### Charisma
- Deception
- Intimidation
- Performance
- Persuasion

Sometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill - for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.”
At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case,
proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that
skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.

For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If
the character is proficient in Athletics, the character's proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character
lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.

In Mass Effect 5e, you may also choose to use the <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/beyond-first-level#paragon-renegade">Variant: Paragon & Renegade</nuxt-link>.
This new rule allows you to apply another bonus to your ability checks, pending the context of your action is "Paragon-ish"
or "Renegade-ish".

### Passive Checks
A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the
average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for laser tripwires over and over again, or can be used when
the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a
hidden sniper.

Here's how to determine a character's total for a passive check:

> 10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check

If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check
total as a score.

For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom
(Perception) score of 14. The rules on hiding in the [Dexterity](#dexterity) section below rely on passive checks, as do
the exploration rules.

### Working together

Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who's leading the effort - or the one with the
highest ability modifier - can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters.
In combat, this requires the __Help__ action.

A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to hack a
security system requires proficiency with hacking tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can't help another
character in that task.

Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some
tasks, such as reloading a thermal clip, are no easier with help.

#### Group Checks
When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check.
In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't.

To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds,
the whole group succeeds.

Otherwise, the group fails. Group checks don't come up very often, and they're most useful when all the characters
succeed or fail as a group. For example, when operatives are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group
Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the
environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of
danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.
