Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.

### Wisdom Checks

A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someoneâ€™s feelings, notice things about the
environment, or care for an injured person. The Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude
in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.
