This section covers the basics of the operative's live, from the mechanics of movement to the complexities of social
interaction. The rules for resting are also in this section, along with a discussion of the activities your character might
pursue between missions.

Whether operatives are exploring an ancient alien ruin or the busy streets of the Citadel, the game follows a natural
rhythm, as outlined in the introduction:

1. The GM describes the environment.
2. The players describe what they want to do.
3. The GM narrates the results of their actions.

Typically, the GM uses a map as an outline of the mission, tracking the characters’ progress as they explore docking bays
or jungle planets. The GM’s notes, including a key to the map, describe what the operatives find as they enter each
new area. Sometimes, the passage of time and the operatives’ actions determine what happens, so the GM might use a
timeline or a flowchart to track their progress instead of a map.
