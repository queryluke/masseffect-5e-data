In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The
GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a space station environment,
the operatives' movement happens on a scale of minutes. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway,
another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the room
beyond for anything interesting or valuable.

In a city or wilderness, a scale of hours is often more appropriate. Operatives eager to reach the lonely base camp at
the foot of a mountain hurry across those 30 kilometers in just under four hours' time (or less if they're using a vehicle).

For long journeys, a scale of days works best. Making mass relay jumps from Sol to the outer skirts of the Terminus Systems,
the operatives spend four uneventful days before a batarian ambush interrupts their journey.

In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on rounds, a 6-second span of time.
