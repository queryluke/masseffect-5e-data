title: 'Social Interaction'
---

Exploring planets, overcoming obstacles, and surviving death squads are key parts of Mass Effect missions. No less important,
though, are the social interactions that operatives have with other inhabitants of the galaxy.

Interaction takes on many forms. You might need to convince an unscrupulous spy to confess to some malfeasance, or you
might try to flatter a shop owner so they will give you a discount. The GM assumes the roles of any characters who are
participating in the interaction that don’t belong to another player at the table. Any such character is called a
__nonplayer character__ (NPC).

In general terms, an NPC’s attitude toward you is described as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly NPCs are
predisposed to help you, and hostile ones are inclined to get in your way. It’s easier to get what you want from a
friendly NPC, of course.

Social interactions have two primary aspects: roleplaying and ability checks.

### Roleplaying
Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this case, it’s you as a player determining how your character
thinks, acts, and talks.

Roleplaying is a part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the fore during social interactions. Your character’s
quirks, mannerisms, and personality influence how interactions resolve.

There are two styles you can use when roleplaying your character: the descriptive approach and the active approach. Most
players use a combination of the two styles. Use whichever mix of the two works best for you.

#### Descriptive Approach to Roleplaying
With this approach, you describe your character’s words and actions to the GM and the other players. Drawing on your mental
image of your character, you tell everyone what your character does and how he or she does it.

When using descriptive roleplaying, keep the following things in mind:

- Describe your character’s emotions and attitude.
- Focus on your character’s intent and how others might perceive it.
- Provide as much embellishment as you feel comfortable with.
- Don’t worry about getting things exactly right. Just focus on thinking about what your character would do and describing
what you see in your mind.

#### Active Approach to Roleplaying
If descriptive roleplaying tells your GM and your fellow players what your character thinks and does, active roleplaying
shows them.

When you use active roleplaying, you speak with your character’s voice, like an actor taking on a role. You might even
echo your character’s movements and body language. This approach is more immersive than descriptive roleplaying, though
you still need to describe things that can’t be reasonably acted out.

#### Results of Roleplaying
The GM uses your character’s actions and attitudes to determine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly NPC buckles under threats
of violence. A stubborn turian refuses to let anyone badger her. A vain asari laps up flattery.

When interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to the GM’s portrayal of the NPC’s mood, dialogue, and personality.
You might be able to determine an NPC’s personality traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds, then play on them to influence
the NPC’s attitude.

Interactions in Mass Effect 5e are much like interactions in real life. If you can offer NPCs something they want, threaten
them with something they fear, or play on their sympathies and goals, you can use words to get almost anything you want.
On the other hand, if you insult a proud warrior or speak ill of a politician’s allies, your efforts to convince or
deceive will fall short.

### Ability Checks
In addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in determining the outcome of an interaction.

Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC’s attitude, but there might still be an element of chance in the situation.
For example, your GM can call for a Charisma check at any point during an interaction if he or she wants the dice to play
a role in determining an NPC’s reactions. Other checks might be appropriate in certain situations, at your GM’s discretion.

Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking of how you want to interact with an NPC, and stack the deck in
your favor by using an approach that relies on your best bonuses and skills. If the group needs to trick a security guard
into letting them into a classified area, the infiltrator who is proficient in Deception is the best bet to lead the
discussion. When negotiating for a hostage’s release, the sentinel with Persuasion should do most of the talking.
