title: 'Between Missions'

Between trips to remote planets and battles against reaper forces, operatives need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare
for their next mission. Many operatives also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting or modding arms and
armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned credits.

In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new mission,
the GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your
character has been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond
your perception stay in motion.

### Lifestyle Expenses
Between missions, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle.

Living a particular lifestyle doesn't have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other
individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to
influence the officials of the city than if you live in poverty.

### Downtime Activities
Between missions, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can
vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit,
and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be
consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer
period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.

Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her
downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.

#### Crafting
You can craft weapons, mods, armor, other equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the
object you are trying to create (typically artisan's tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations
necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with armorsmith's tools needs a source of power and intense heat
in order to craft armor or install mods.

For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 500 credits,
and you must expend raw materials or omni-gel worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market
value greater than 500 credits, you make progress every day in 500-credit increments until you reach the market value of
the item. For example, Blood Dragon Armor (market value 101,300 credits) takes 203 days to craft by yourself.

Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all
have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 1000 credits
worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool
proficiency and the proper facilities can craft the Blood Dragon Armor in 68 days, at a total cost of 50,650 credits.

While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 150 credits per day, or a comfortable
lifestyle at half the normal cost.

#### Practicing a Profession
You can work between missions, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 150 credits per day.
This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession. If you are a member of an organization that can provide
gainful employment you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.

If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn
enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.

#### Recuperating
You can use downtime between missions to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.

After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save,
you can choose one of the following results:

- End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.
- For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.

#### Researching
The time between missions is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over
the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over the exonet, buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and
gossip from their lips, or paying for information from certain factions like the Shadow Broker Network.

When you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will
take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual,
file, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation)
check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone's aid,
or an Intelligence (Electronics) check to hack into a database. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information
if it is available.

For each day of research, you must spend 100 credits to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your
normal lifestyle expenses.

#### Training
You can spend time between missions training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training options.

First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more
ability checks are required.

The training lasts for 250 days and costs 100 credits per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money,
you gain proficiency with the new tool.
