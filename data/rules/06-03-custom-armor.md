title: 'Custom Armor'

For characters that want to create unique armor pieces, they can craft or purchase upgradable armor pieces. To craft armor
pieces, your character needs to be proficient with Armorsmith's or Tailor's tools. Then they must spend the necessary
amount of time and omni-gel as listed in the Customizable Armor Costs table. _Note: it takes much less time and resources to craft
these basic armor pieces than it does to craft armor sets due to the simplicity of the armor your character is creating_.

Characters may instead purchase customizable armor for the cost listed in the Customizable Armor Costs table.

Once you have crafted or purchased your armor piece, it is time to add benefits to the armor using __armor mods__. Each
piece of customizable armor has a set number of mod slots and you can add additional slots (up to the maximum) for more
time and omni-gel (if crafting) or credits (if purchasing). You must select a mod with a matching armor piece, i.e. chest,
head, legs, or arms.

<p><strong>EXAMPLE ARMOR CREATION</strong></p>
<p>Imogen wants to create a fancy chest piece for her character Tiiva. She wants to add another mod slot for a
maximum of 3 armor mods. Tiiva spends 4 long rests (8 hours in each rest) and 20 omni-gel to create a medium piece of
chest armor. Alternatively, she could have spent 30,000 credits to purchase the armor piece. Next Imogen spends 30,000 credits
on the ablative coating mod. She also looted an asymmetric defense layer mod from a previous
mission. She spends 2 more long rests applying those mods, giving her chest armor resistance to piercing damage
and +2 AC. She leaves her third slot empty for the time being, hoping to loot another mod and fit it in later.</p>

#### Rewarding Custom Armor
Your GM might reward you with a custom piece of armor that you've looted or found during a mission. When you are rewarded
with a custom piece of armor, make sure you write down how many total mod slots the piece has and what armor mods are
currently installed.
