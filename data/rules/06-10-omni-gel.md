Omni-gel is a technological material that can be obtained by breaking down unwanted items, such as weapons, armor, and
upgrades. Doing so will usually give an amount of omni-gel based on the item that was dismantled.

Omni-gel is composed of common, reusable industrial plastics, ceramics, and light alloys kept in a semi-molten state.
It is designed for use with omni-tools to do electronics and decryption work, make general repairs, and even craft new upgrades.
Each "charge" of omni-gel is stored in a canister and is worth 1,000 credits.
