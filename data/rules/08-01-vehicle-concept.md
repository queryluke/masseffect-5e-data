Unlike in traditional 5e fantasy settings, in the Mass Effect universe, players and GMs can expect to be both
frequently and actively involved in the operation of modes of transportation beyond animal mounts, wagons, and
sailing ships. This module is intended to be a “bolt-on” set of rules to use in ME5e campaigns where significant
playtime is dedicated to the use of vehicles, both for travel and combat. If your campaign only uses
vehicles as a narrative bridge or as “set dressing” you do not need to include these rules in your game.
