There isn't any traditional fantasy "magic" in Mass Effect 5e but there are super-powered abilities, advanced technology,
and fantastic items. Mass Effect 5e retains the word "spell" as a catch-all to describe special powers that are available
to the game's classes.

Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions,
drain life energy away, and restore health to the injured.
