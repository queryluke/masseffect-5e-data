Every character belongs to a species, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the Mass Effect Universe. The most
common player character species are asari, humans, krogan, salarians, and turians. The [species](/species) section
provides more information about each available species.

The species you choose contributes to your character’s identity in an important way, by establishing a general appearance
and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character’s species grants particular traits, such as
special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor
powers. These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For example, the
traits of batarians make them exceptional soldiers, and asari tend to be powerful adepts. Sometimes playing against type
can be fun, too. Salarian soldiers and krogan engineers, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters.

Your species also increases one or more of your ability scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these increases and
remember to apply them later.

Record the traits granted by your species on your character sheet. Be sure to note your base speed and size as well.

__BUILDING KALEEM, STEP 1__
Sam is sitting down to create her character. She decides that a wiley salarian fits the character she wants to play and
she knows she wants to play with tech powers available to the engineer or infiltrator class, both of which are available
classes for the salarian species. She notes all the racial traits of salarians on her character sheet, including her speed
of <me-distance length="25" /> and Medium size.
