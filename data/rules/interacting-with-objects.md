A character's interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM
that his or her character is doing something, such as interacting with a terminal, and the GM describes what, if anything,
happens.

For example, a character might decide to interact with a terminal, which might, in turn, open a door, raise an alarm, or
give the character access to a map of the building. If the terminal is protected via security, though, a character might need
to hack it. In such a situation, the GM might call for an Intelligence (Electronics) check to see whether the character can
bypass the security. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.

Characters can also damage objects with their weapons, biotics, and tech. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage,
but otherwise, they can be affected by physical attacks much as creatures can. The GM determines an object's Armor Class
and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks.
(It's hard to cut a cable with a hammer, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and
they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.

A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.
