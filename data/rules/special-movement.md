Movement through underground tunnels, skyscrapers, or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Operatives
might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.

### Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling
While climbing or swimming, each meter of movement costs <me-distance length="1" override="extra {metric}" />
(<me-distance length="2" override="extra {metric}" /> in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed.
At the GMâ€™s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics)
check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.

### Jumping <v-chip color="warning" text-color="black" small>change</v-chip>
Your Strength determines how far you can jump.

__Long Jump__. When you make a long jump, you cover a number of <me-distance length="0" /> up to your Strength score <me-distance length="0" text-if="metric" override="divided by three (rounded up)" />,
if you move at least <me-distance length="10" /> on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance.
Either way, each <me-distance length="0" /> you clear on the jump costs a <me-distance length="0" /> of movement.

This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM's option,
you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance),
such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.

When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.

__High Jump__. When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of <me-distance length="0" /> equal to 3 + your Strength modifier
<me-distance text-if="metric" length="0" override="divided by three (rounded up)" /> if you move at least <me-distance length="10" />
on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can
jump only half that distance. Either way, each <me-distance length="0" /> you clear on the jump costs a <me-distance length="0" /> of movement. In some circumstances,
your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.

You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal
to the height of the jump plus 1 1/2 times your height.

### +/- Gravity <v-chip color="info" small>new</v-chip>
Operatives may find themselves in an environment with little, no, or increased gravity. For any increase (or decrease) that
is twice as more (or less) than your operatives normal working gravity, use the difficult terrain rules. I.e., if your
operative normally works in a 1g environment, and enters a .5g or 2g environment, they are considered to be in difficult terrain.

If you're in a low gravity environment, your long and high jump distances are doubled. Jump distances are halved in higher
gravity.

When in a 0g environment, your speed becomes 0, unless you have a means of propelling yourself. Additional rules, such as
disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws or melee attacks, are decided by the GM based on the context of your environment.
