title: Starting Equipment
section: equipment
order: 1
---
When you create your character, you receive equipment based on a combination of your class and background. Alternatively,
you can start with a number of credits based on your species and spend them on items from the lists in this section. See
the [Choose Equipment](/manual/character-creation#choose-equipment) section of __Step-by-step Characters__
for more information on using racial starting credits.

You decide how your character came by this starting equipment. It might have been an inheritance or goods that the
character purchased during his or her upbringing. You might have been equipped with a weapon, armor, and a backpack as
part of military service. You might even have stolen your gear. A weapon could be a family heirloom, passed down from
generation to generation until your character finally took up the mantle and followed in an ancestorâ€™s adventurous footsteps.

When you optionally choose to use your racial starting credits, you do not gain any recommended equipment packages
from your chosen class nor your chosen background.
