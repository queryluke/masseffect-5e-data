    shortDesc: >-
      When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within <me-distance length="5" /> of you
      with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage of the attack by 1d10 + your proficiency
      bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You suffer the reduced damage instead and the target gains Avatar’s Inspiration ({{avatarsDie}}).
