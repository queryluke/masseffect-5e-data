Once a VI with a hard-light holographic interface, the Hologram has gained sentience either through a programming error or an intentional test brought on by an experiment into “friendly” AI. Unlike other sentient AI’s that struggle to understand humanoids, Holograms were programmed from the ground up to be empathetic and relatable.
