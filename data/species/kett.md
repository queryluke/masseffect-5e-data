name: Kett
alignment: >-
  Kett view all other species as inferior, but follow a strict hierarchy, generally making them Lawful Evil.
size: >-
  Kett have a similar height to humans with slightly bulkier builds due to the external bones. Your size is Medium.
snippet: >-
  Kett are a dangerous race native to the Andromeda galaxy. They prize physical supremacy and genetic dominance,
  assimilating conquered peoples.
age: >-
  The Kett lifespan is currently undetermined. The only known datapoint is that the Archon
  of the Heleus contingent has been active in cluster affairs for over seven decades. Due to their unique
  reproduction process via exaltation, Kett are fully mature when the exaltation is complete.

Kett are a dangerous race native to the Andromeda galaxy. They are brutal conquerors from an unknown area of Andromeda
beyond the borders of the Heleus Cluster. Seemingly genderless, they prize physical supremacy and genetic dominance,
assimilating conquered peoples. The kett believe their species is superior to all others, and as such, the conquered
have two fates: either become Exalted, altered on a genetic level to become kett, or enslaved for the glory of the
empire.

### Threat from the Void
The kett are not native to the Heleus Cluster, which they call Sector 1-19-NYKZ, and began invading it in 2744.
When the angara encountered them, the kett lured them into a false sense of security with gifts and offers of
friendship, before kidnapping their leadership and providing information which provoked arguments between angaran
worlds. Little is known about how large the Kett empire truly is, but the advance on the Heleus Cluster represents
only a portion of their invading force.

### Masters of Bioengineering
The kett possess technology that is comparable in advancement to the Andromeda Initiative, but have an unparalleled
mastery of biotechnology and medical technology. Bio-engineered components are used in all of their machines and
devices. Instead of conventional research and development programs, kett prefer to improve their technology
incrementally by taking features and designs from other species' technology.

### Exaltation
Kett possess no reproductive organs, and they reproduce only through an artificial process called exaltation. It is
speculated that exaltation arose long ago in kett history when their genetics reached a point of stagnation, leaving
the species unable to breed through natural means. The kett began adding beneficial genes from other species into their
own genome in order to continually improve themselves, which they refer to as harmonization. Kett mastery over genetic
manipulation enabled them to develop a serum to rapidly convert other species into obedient kett, which became the
basis for exaltation.

Kett biology retains traits taken from many other species. One such trait is that kett can survive for limited periods
in inhospitable environments without protective suits, including vacuum. However, nothing from the original species'
body is left: a kett exalted from an angara, for example, only has traces of angaran genome remaining. Internal scans
show kett organs, not angaran ones. They are physically kett, for all intents and purposes, and exaltation appears to
be permanent and irreversible thus far.

The kett revere exaltation as a sacred ritual, believing that the species selected to undergo exaltation are ascending
to greatness while helping the kett do the same. These subjugated species are initially called "Chosen", and may later
advance to higher tiers with the kett hierarchy, such as "Anointed".

### Kett Names
Kett are mostly known through titles related to their position in society. Their personal names as translated appear
to consist of barely pronounceable strings of consonants with no vowels.
