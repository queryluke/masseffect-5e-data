Tank-bred krogan were developed by the warlord Okeer, who was originally investigating the genophage. However,
Okeer gradually became obsessed with his work and realized that surviving the genophage had become the only
benchmark for a good krogan, which was weakening the species as a whole. He decided to produce a genetically pure,
superior krogan—a super soldier—and poured all his efforts into his experiments, even seeking help from the Collectors.

As a tank-bred krogan, you may be a prototype from Okeer’s research or developed in another lab setting that
branched off of Okeer’s research.
