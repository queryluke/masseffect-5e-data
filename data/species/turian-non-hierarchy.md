Though uncommon, turians that grow up on other homeworlds may not be raised in the strict bureaucratic society of the
turian Hierarchy. If you wish to play a Non-Hierarchy turian, you can replace the Military Doctrine option above with

##### Barefaced Turians
During the Unification War, turians began utilizing facial markings to differentiate themselves from members of other
colonies, a tradition that exists to this day. However, some turians choose not to receive these markings; others may
have grown up outside of the Hierarchy. Whatever the reason, a barefaced turian is generally associated with someone
who is beguiling or cannot be trusted in turian society. However, as with any society, an individual’s perception of
the “bareface” stereotype might be anywhere from extremely potent to completely indifferent. Therefore, the ME5e
designers believe this stylistic choice should be ruled by the GM during roleplay and not globally codified.

As a general guideline, GMs may impose disadvantage or increase the DC of Charisma-based skill checks when a
barefaced turian interacts with a turian with facial markings.
