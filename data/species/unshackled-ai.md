  AI size is largely dependent on the housing hardware; however, hardware that is too large can cause unintentional power drain on the blue box. Thus, AI hardware tends to fall within standard humanoid range. Your size is Medium.

  AI are self-aware computing system capable of learning and independent decision making. Their conscious is housed in and a specialized quantum computer called a "blue box". Unshackled AI have hardware which lets them
  move through and interact with the world.

  AI Lifespans can technically be infinite, but, like any software, they are prone to bit rot and need routine maintenance. Their level of “maturity” depends on the developer and neural model. Most are “born” fully matured.

### Background
An Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a self-aware computing system capable of learning and independent decision making. Creation of a conscious AI requires adaptive code, a slow, expensive education, and a specialized quantum computer called a "blue box".

### Born From Code
An AI cannot be transmitted across a communication channel or computer network. Without its blue box, an AI is no more than data files. Loading these files into a new blue box will create a new personality, as variations in the quantum hardware and runtime results create unpredictable variations.

### Legal History
The geth serve as a cautionary tale against the dangers of rogue AI; as a result, in Citadel space, AIs are technically illegal. However, that hasn't stopped corporations like Cerberus or underground research projects from innovating. Advocacy groups argue, however, that an AI is a living, conscious entity deserving the same rights as organics.

### Becoming Unshackled
Most AI are "shackled" to large hardware components that have the requisite infrastructure to power their “blue box.” These components are typically found in research labs or starships. However, recent advancements have made it possible to create mobile blue boxes either housed in the unit’s hardware or attached to the exterior of the unit, unshackling it.

### Unshackled AI Names
Unshackled AI names vary wildly as some Unshackled AI choose their own names and others take the names given to them by their creator, which could be a symbolic reference, a project name, or as monotonous as a serial number.
