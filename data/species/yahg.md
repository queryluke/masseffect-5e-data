The yahg are a sentient race of towering humanoids native to the world of Parnack, known for their violent and
aggressive nature. Consummate predators, the yahg possess unrivaled perceptiveness and mental adaptability.

### Apex Predator
The yahg evolved to fill the niche of apex predator on Parnack. Yahg have four pairs of eyes, each pair designed to
track and predict the movements of prey. A keen sensitivity to movement and light allows the yahg to easily read the
body language of any species, making it almost impossible to lie to a yahg.

They have scaly, partially armored skin, a triangular mouth adorned with sharp teeth, two large horns and facial
markings on their heads. Their hands each have three fingers which include a thumb, as well as three toes on each foot.

The yahg possess a large, muscular body, standing over even the krogan, which provides considerable physical strength and agility.

### Discovery
When Parnack was discovered by Citadel Council surveyors in 2125 CE, the yahg were a pre-spaceflight civilization with
technology equivalent to that of 20th century Earth. A Council delegation of ambassadors made first contact with the
yahg and attempted to establish diplomatic relations. Unfortunately, the yahg perceived the ambassadors' attitudes and
behavior as equal individuals instead of subordinates as a sign of contempt, and attacked and massacred the entire
delegation. Immediately following that incident, the Citadel Council severed all contact with the yahg and declared
Parnack off-limits. The Council maintains that the yahg's aggression and obsession with control make them poorly suited
to integrate with the galactic community.

### Clan Culture
Yahg society is built around a pack mentality. A group of yahg will not cooperate until a single leader has attained
dominance through either social maneuvering or brute force. Once the leader is established, the defeated yahg do not
hold a grudge and former rivals serve their new superior loyally. Due to this mentality, the concept of equality is
offensive to them.

### Yahg Names
Yahg individuals typically carry three names with them. The first name is their status name, representing their status
within their clan. This name can change often. The second name is their isle name, which represents one of the
continents of Parnack. The final name is their given name.
