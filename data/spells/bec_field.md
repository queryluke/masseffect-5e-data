You generate a Bose-Einstein Condensate field around your armor that acts to entangle incoming attacks on a quantum level. 
You gain 5 temporary hit points for the duration. If a creature hits you with a melee attack while you have these hit 
points, the creature takes 5 cold damage.

__At Higher Levels__. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, both the temporary 
hit points and the cold damage increase by 5 for each slot.
