Choose one object weighing 1 to 10 kilos (about 2 to 20 lbs.) within range that isn't being worn or carried. The object
flies in a straight line up to 30m in a direction you choose before falling to the ground, stopping early if it impacts
against a solid surface. If the object would strike a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a
failed save, the object strikes the creature and stops moving. When the object strikes something, the object and what it
strikes each take 3d10 bludgeoning damage.

__At Higher Levels__: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the maximum weight of objects
that you can target with this spell increases by 5 kilos (10lbs), and the damage increases by 2d10, for each slot level
above 1st.
