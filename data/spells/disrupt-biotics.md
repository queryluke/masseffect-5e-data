Attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a biotic spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 2nd level
or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 3rd level or higher, make an ability check
using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + twice spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails and
has no effect.

__At Higher Levels__. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the interrupted spell has no
effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.
