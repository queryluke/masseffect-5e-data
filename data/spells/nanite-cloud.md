Deploy a cloud of fabricated nanites from your omni-tool that swarm and capture incoming energy from an attack, lessening 
its effect on you and storing it for your next attack. Until the end of your next turn, you gain resistance to the 
triggering damage type, including against the triggering attack.

The next time you hit with a melee attack or single-target, tech spell, the target takes an extra 4d6 damage of the triggering
damage type, and the spell ends.

__At Higher Levels__. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6
for each spell slot about the 1st.
