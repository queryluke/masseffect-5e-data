  description: When you cast salvo, you may create phosphorous darts instead. The darts no longer deal damage and
    cannot detonate primed targets. Instead, each dart explodes in a bright flash of light. Each creature hit by a
    dart must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or becomes blinded until the end of your next turn.

Create three glowing darts of plasma. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart
deals 1d4+1 radiant damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously and you can direct them to hit one
creature or several.

__At Higher Levels__. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates two
more darts for each slot level above 1st.
