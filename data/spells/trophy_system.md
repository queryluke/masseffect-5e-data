Your omni-tool's trophy system detects incoming explosives that fires a small ordinance charge to preemptively detonate 
hostile explosives. As a reaction to an explosive projectile (grenade or rocket from a heavy weapon) that you can see 
within 6 meters of you, you may preemptively detonate it. If the blast would cause you to make a Dexterity saving throw,
you have advantage on the save.   

You may use this ability only once per long rest.
