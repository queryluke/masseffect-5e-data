Kett DNA is implanted into subjects through several rounds of injections,
building up the subject's systems, while kett scientists take the opportunity
to run further tests upon the subject's genetic structure in hopes of isolating
valuable traits to be harvested and applied to the rest of the species.

As kett gain rank and the patronage of their superiors, so too do they receive
further genetic modifications, up to and including traits acquired from newer
species encountered and assimilated into the Empire.
