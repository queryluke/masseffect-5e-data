name: Mobile Platform
---
Your mobile platform is your “body”, a mechanical structure that your consciousness inhabits. The platform provides
additional benefits based on its model. You can change your platform provided you have a new platform to inhabit
and spend 8 hours in an unconscious state as you transfer your programs from one platform to another.

:::alert
Should your platform become damaged beyond repair, the persistence of your consciousness is dependent
on numerous variables, such as the time since your most recent back-up, network availability to a hub,
and the location(s) of your consciousness’ storage. Work with your GM to decide if your consciousness
is recoverable and the process in which you will need to be loaded into a new platform.
