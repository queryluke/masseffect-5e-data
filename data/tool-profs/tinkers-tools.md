A set of tinker's tools is designed to create small, inventive devices from omni-gel. Some examples include a motion sensor,
a desalinator, a compass, a light source, or a small EMP device.

__History__. You can determine the age and origin of objects, even if you have only a few pieces remaining from the original.

__Investigation__. When you inspect a damaged object, you gain knowledge of how it was damaged and how long ago.

__Mending__. For 1 omni-gel, you can repair a single break or tear in an object, such as a punctured tire, a cracked helmet, or a ripped pack.
As long as the break or tear is no larger than 30 cm (~ 1 foot) in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

__Repair__. You can restore 10 hit points to a damaged object for 1 omni-gel and an hour of work.

__Craft Armor or Weapon Mod__. See the [crafting](/manual/missions#between-missions) section
of downtime activities for more information.
