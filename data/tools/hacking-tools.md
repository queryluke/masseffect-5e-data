Hacking tools are used to override security systems in order to gain access to encrypted files, open locked doors, or
sabotage security devices such as cameras, turrets, or mechs. Proficiency with the tools also grants you a general knowledge
of VIs, encryption techniques, and cryptography.

__Components__. A port-cable fabricator (includes schematics for all 238 Human USB standards!), a library of
security counter-measure scripts, and an air-gapped computer interface.

__Perception__. You're understanding of patterns and cryptography gives you insight when discerning information from unknown languages.

__Investigation__. You gain additional insight when utilizing networked systems (such as the exonet) to find information.

__Fortify__. Just as you can break down security, you can also fortify it. For each hour of work,
you can further encrypt an electronic data package, rebuff a security device, or harden a network to attack, increasing
the DC to hack it by 1 (maximum 5).
