Thieves' tools are used to _manually_ disarm traps, breach security doors, and open locked containers. Criminals prefer thieves'
tools over hacking tools because they're cheaper and more reliable. For most, trying to outsmart a security VI can be near impossible,
but snipping a few wires is easy if you know the right ones to cut. Proficiency with the tools also grants you a general knowledge
of traps, security systems, and locks.

__Components__. A cordless screwdriver, a set of common security panel slicers, a 1m long endoscope, a spray can of liquid nitrogen,
and a pair of pliers with wire-cutter insets.

__History__. Your knowledge of security systems grants you insight when answering questions about locations that are renowned for their
security.

__Investigation and Perception__. You gain additional insight when looking for traps and alarms because you have learned a variety of
common signs that betray their presence.

__Set a trap__. Just as you can disable traps, you can also set them. As part of a short rest, you can use 1 create a trap
using 1 omni-gel and any other items you have on hand. The total of your check becomes the DC for someone else's attempt to discover
or disable the trap. The trap deals damage appropriate to the materials used in crafting it (such as poison or a weapon)
or damage equal to half the total of your check, whichever the GM deems appropriate.
