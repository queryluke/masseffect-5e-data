Whenever you have less than half your hit points remaining and suffer damage to your hit points, you must succeed on a
DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or enter a blind rage, immediately losing concentration on any powers you are maintaining.
You must also make the saving throw whenever you choose to enter your blood rage.

While in a blind rage, you must use your action and any potential bonus actions or reactions each round to attack the
creature nearest to you. If you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra attacks,
moving to attack the next nearest creature after you kill your current target. If you have multiple possible targets,
you attack one at random.

You are in a blind range until you die, are incapacitated, or start your turn with no creatures within
<me-distance length="60" /> of you that you can see or hear.
