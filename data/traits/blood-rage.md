When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can choose to not fall unconscious and enter a
blood rage instead. When you enter your blood rage, you lose concentration on any powers you are maintaining.

The blood rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you regain hit points or if your turn ends and
you haven’t attacked a hostile creature or taken damage since the end of your last turn.

For the duration, you are immune to being charmed or frightened and the only Action you may take is
either Attack or Dash. You continue to make death saving throws as normal and damage causes death saving throw
failures. However, no amount of success or failures cause you to stabilize or die until blood rage ends.
Additionally, when you would receive a death saving throw success you may, instead, remove a death saving throw
failure, or vice versa.

When blood rage ends, if you have four or more death saving throw failures, you die. Otherwise,
you fall unconscious.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
