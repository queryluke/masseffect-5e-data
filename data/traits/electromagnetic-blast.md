You know the Overload power and it doesnâ€™t count against your powers known or
prepared. Once per long rest, you may cast a 1-tech-point version of it. Wisdom
is your powercasting modifier for it.

You cannot learn an advancement for it, but you may prepare another version of
Overload with advancements as you class permits.
