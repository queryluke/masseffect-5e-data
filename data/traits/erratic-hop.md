      DEX save, gain advantage.

Your genes and training are hard for most to understand, resulting in unpredictable
fighting styles. When a creature you can see attacks you, you can use your reaction
to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. Alternatively, whenever you make a
Dexterity saving throw, you may use your reaction to gain advantage on the saving throw.

You can use this trait a number of times between long rests equal to your proficiency bonus.
