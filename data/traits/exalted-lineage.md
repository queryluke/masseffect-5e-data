You are an exalted version of another species. Pick an organic specie (or synthetic at you
GM's discretion) species and gain the following elements from it: any ability score increases, any skill
proficiencies, and any climbing, flying, or swimming speed.

If you are not using an exalted version, you may instead gain +2 Constitution,
+1 to another ability score of your choice, and proficiency in two skills of
your choice.
