You have an exoskeleton which contains fluid-filled sacs that capture dissolved
gasses from the circulatory system, slowly releasing them if you are oxygen-deprived
and can stabilize internal body pressure.

Your AC when not wearing armor is 12 + your Constitution modifier. You can use your
natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a
lower AC. A held shieldâ€™s benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.

Additionally, you can hold your breath or survive in the vacuum of space for up to one hour.
