Your eye can emit a powerful and damaging laser beam that is a natural ranged weapon with a normal range of 36m (90ft)
and no long range. You are considered proficient with it and add your Dexterity modifier to its attack rolls. If you
hit with it, you deal radiant damage equal to 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier.
