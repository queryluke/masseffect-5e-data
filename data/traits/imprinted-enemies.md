Your tank imprints have also imparted tactics and knowledge against specific species. Choose two species to be
your imprinted enemies.

You have advantage on Intelligence checks to recall information about your imprinted enemies.

The first time on each of your turns that you hit a creature of your imprinted enemies’ species with a weapon attack,
you can roll one of the weapon’s damage dice an additional time and add it as extra damage of the weapon’s damage type.
