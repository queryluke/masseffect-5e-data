Your body has built-in defensive layers, which determine your armor class. You gain no benefit from wearing armor,
but if you are wielding a weapon or shield that provides additional AC, you apply its bonus as normal.

You can alter your armor type for 2 omni-gel each time you finish a long rest. Choose one mode to adopt from the
Integrated Protection table, provided you meet the modeâ€™s prerequisite.

Mode | Prerequisite | AC
--- | --- | ---
Lithe | None | 11 + your Dexterity Modifier. Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
Composite Plating | Medium armor proficiency | 12 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum of 2) + proficiency bonus
Asymmetric Defense Plating | Heavy armor proficiency | 15 + proficiency bonus. Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

### Innate Shielding
You have 5 shields (regen 5). You can upgrade these by using armor mods.

### Armor Mods

You can augment your armor by integrating armor mods into your system. You can spend 8 hours removing, adding, or
replacing a mod. When you remove or replace a mod in this way, the replaced or removed mod is lost. The mod cannot be salvaged,
not even with the assistance of Armorsmith's or Tailor's tools.

You have 2 chest mod slots, 1 mod slot in your arms, legs, and head each. You cannot add new slots in any way.
