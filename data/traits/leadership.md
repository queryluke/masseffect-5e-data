Whenever a friendly creature you can see makes an attack roll or saving throw, you may use your reaction to issue a 
special warning or command. The creature can add a d4 to its roll, provided it can hear you.

You can use this trait between short or long rests a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum once).
