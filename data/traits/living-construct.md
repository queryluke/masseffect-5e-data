You are immune to psychic and poison damage, the poisoned condition, and disease. You do not need to eat, drink, or breathe.
When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping.
In this state, you appear inert, but it doesnâ€™t render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.
