    shortDesc: Summon your projection within <me-distance length="30" />
---
As a bonus action, you may recall or summon your projection within your own space or in an unoccupied space within <me-distance length="30" />. The projection lasts indefinitely and dissipates if its hit points are reduced to 0, it falls unconscious, it moves farther than <me-distance length="30" /> from your emitter, or it moves to a location which has full cover from your emitter.

You cannot summon your projection if it has 0 hit points.
