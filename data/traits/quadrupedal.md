You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag.

In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your size and weight. 
When you make such a climb, each <me-distance length="1" /> of movement costs you 
<me-distance length="4" override="extra {metric}"/>, instead of the normal <me-distance length="1" override="extra {metric}"/>.

Finally, a Medium or smaller creature can ride on your back if you allow it. In such a situation, you continue 
to act independently, not as a controlled mount.
