name: Tentacles
species: hanar

You have six tentacles instead of arms that can grip tightly but can't lift anything heavier than a few kilograms, meaning
you can only wield weapons with the _light_ property. 

In addition, your tentacles are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, 
you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for 
an unarmed strike. Immediately after hitting a target with your tentacle attack, you can attempt to grapple the target 
as a bonus action.

If a creature is grappled by one of your tentacles, you may use your action to secrete a toxin into the creature.
It must succeed a Constitution saving throw or becomes <me-condition id="poisoned"/> for 1 hour. The DC of this
saving throw is equal to 11 + your proficiency bonus.
