The M35 Mako infantry fighting vehicle was designed for the Systems Alliance's frigates. It is designed to fulfill the
role of rapid deployment that its predecessor, the M29 Grizzly, fell short of accomplishing. Though the interior is
cramped, an M35 is small enough to be carried in the cargo bay and easily deployed on virtually any world.
