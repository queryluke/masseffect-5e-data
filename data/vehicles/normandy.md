The SSV Normandy SR-1 (__S__ystems Alliance __S__pace __V__ehicle __Normandy__ __S__tealth __R__econnaissance-1) was a
Systems Alliance starship. She is a prototype "deep scout" frigate, first of the eponymous Normandy class, co-developed
by the Alliance and the Turian Hierarchy with the sponsorship of the Citadel Council. She is optimized for solo
reconnaissance missions deep within unstable regions, using state-of-the-art stealth technology powered by an experimental drive core.

__Stealth Technology__. The Normandy-class frigate has experimental stealth technology. Any rolls made to scan the ship are
made at disadvantage.

__Additional Systems__: The Normandy-class frigate has a _Medbay_, _Rec Room_, __GARDIAN__ system, and 4 open additional
system slots.
