The UT-47 Kodiak Drop Shuttle is a personnel carrier capable of planetary flight and is capable of limited FTL travel.
The shuttle is used extensively by (but not limited to) the Systems Alliance and Cerberus in 2186. The Kodiak and
several variants have also seen extensive use in the Andromeda Galaxy's Heleus Cluster by the Andromeda Initiative
nearly 600 years later.
