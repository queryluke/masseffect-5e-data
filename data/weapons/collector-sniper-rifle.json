  "notes": "The Collector Sniper Rifle does not use thermal clips. Instead, use a d4 to track the \"heat\". Whenever you make a ranged attack with the weapon, spin down the die 1 face. Every round that you don't fire the weapon, spin the die up 1 face. This represents the weapon internally cooling off. If you ever spin down the die to 0, the weapon jams and cannot be fired again this combat. If you make a Burst Fire attack, spin down the die by 2.",
