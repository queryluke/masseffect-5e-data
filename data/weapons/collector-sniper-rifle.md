The Collector Sniper Rifle does not use thermal clips. Instead, use a d4 to track the "heat". 
Whenever you make a ranged attack with the weapon, spin down the die 1 face. Every round that you 
don't fire the weapon, spin the die up 1 face. This represents the weapon internally cooling off. If 
you ever spin down the die to 0, the weapon jams and cannot be fired again this combat. If you make 
a Burst Fire attack, spin down the die by 2.
