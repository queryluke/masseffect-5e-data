When you hit with an attack using this weapon, the target takes an additional 1d4 lightning damage. 
If the target maintaining a concentration power, it automatically fails its saving throw to maintain 
that power. An angara wielding this weapon deals an additional 2d4 lightning damage instead of 
1d4.
