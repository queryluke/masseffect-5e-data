When you hit a target beyond normal range, it takes half damage.

The Equalizer does not use thermal clips. Instead, use a d8 to track the "heat". Whenever you make a 
ranged attack with the weapon, spin down the die 1 face. Every round that you don't fire the weapon, 
spin the die up 1 face. If you ever spin down the die to 0, the weapon jams and cannot be fired 
again this combat. If you make a Burst Fire attack, spin down the die by 2.
