If you remain targeting until the start of your next turn, fire a unique missile that automatically hits the target . The missile deploys 3 shaped charges. The first disrupts any barriers or shields, completely removing all barrier ticks and shield points. The second charge cripples armor; the creature's is reduced by 3 for the next hour. The final charge explodes and the creature must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save the creature takes 4d12 thunder damage or half as much on a successful one.",
