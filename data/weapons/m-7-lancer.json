  "notes": "Somewhat of a relic and hard to come by, the M-7 does not use thermal clips. Instead, use a d8 to track the \\\"heat\\\". Whenever you make a ranged attack with the weapon, spin down the die 1 face. Every round that you don't fire the weapon, spin the die up 2 faces. This represents the weapon internally cooling off. If you ever spin down the die to 0, the weapon jams and cannot be fired again this combat. If you make a Burst Fire attack, spin down the die by 2.",
