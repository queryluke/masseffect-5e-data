The Particle Rifle does not use thermal clips. Instead, use a d6 to track the "heat". Whenever you 
make a ranged attack with the weapon, spin down the die 1 face. Every round that you don't fire the 
weapon, spin the die up 1 face. This represents the weapon internally cooling off. If you ever spin 
down the die to 0, the weapon jams and cannot be fired again this combat. If you make a Burst Fire 
attack, spin down the die by 2.
