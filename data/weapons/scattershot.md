The Scattershot does not use thermal clips. Instead, use a d4 to track the "heat". Whenever you make 
a ranged attack with the weapon, spin down the die 1 face. Every round that you don't fire the 
weapon, spin the die up 1 face. This represents the weapon internally cooling off. If you ever spin 
down the die to 0, the weapon jams and cannot be fired again this combat.
