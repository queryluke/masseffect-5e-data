The DC of this saving throw equals 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus (if you are proficient with Assault Rifles). A creature takes thunder damage equal to the weapon's damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Each creature within the radius has advantage on the saving throw the target area is beyond the normal range of this weapon.",
