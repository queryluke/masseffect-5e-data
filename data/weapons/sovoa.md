Instead of making a ranged weapon attack, target an area within normal or long range of this weapon. 
Each creature within a <me-distance length="10" /> radius of the target makes a Dexterity saving 
throw. The DC of this saving throw equals 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus (if 
you are proficient with Assault Rifles). A creature takes thunder damage equal to the weapon's 
damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Each creature within the radius has 
advantage on the saving throw the target area is beyond the normal range of this 
weapon.
