The Sweeper does not use thermal clips. Instead, use a d6 to track the "heat". Whenever you make a 
ranged attack with the weapon, spin down the die 1 face. Every round that you don't fire the weapon, 
spin the die up 1 face. This represents the weapon internally cooling off. If you ever spin down the 
die to 0, the weapon jams and cannot be fired again this combat. If you make a Burst Fire attack, 
spin down the die by 2.
