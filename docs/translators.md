# Translators

If you'd like to work on a translation for ME5e, you should review the following information.

- [I want to become and official translator for this system](#official-translators)
- [I noticed an error in a translation](#updating-errors)


## Official Translators

### What does becoming an official translator mean?
In short, it means that you're agreeing to maintain a translation for this system, which will include re-translating content
as updates are made.

### What do I get?
Sadly, not much...this is a truly free product. To avoid the ire and copyright lawsuits of any higher powers and IP owners,
we don't accept any gifts (monetary or otherwise) to maintain Mass Effect 5e.

All we can do is add your name and an avatar image to the "About" section of the website.

### What do I need to know?
At the very least, be fluent in the language you want to translate the rules into. We don't want any Google Translate copy/paste
jobs, as this content is dense with formalized language and table-top game contexts that Google Translate won't pick up.

Next, you should either have experience or be willing to learn [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
Generally speaking, you won't need to code anything, but you should be able to recognize when something is code syntax vs.
text that needs to be translated. If this part worries you, we are more than happy to help you along the way.

Then, you should be fine with creating a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) and downloading a simple content editor
(we recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/))

Finally, you should be willing to keep in touch via Discord, Reddit, or email. Letting us know when you can no longer
be an official translator.

If you want to get a better sense of what is required, you can read the [Translation Guide](/translation-guide)

### What's the time commitment
This is difficult to say. The first major time commitment is translating everything. That's entirely dependant on how
quickly you can translate something. Roughly around 200 pages of content.

After the initial translation, there will be updates happening: rule changes or entirely new content. As the changes happen,
we _prefer_ official translators be available to make updates quickly. In the event of an update, you will be provided
with a list of things that need to be re-translated and you will be notified well in advance of the change.

That said, these updates will likely only happen a few times a year at most.

### I want to become an official translator, how do I start?

Contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/c2UnqkH) or via email (info@n7.world). We want to make sure there isn't a translation
already happening. If there is, we'll put you in touch with the person working on the translation and the two of you can collaborate.

Once we know you want to be an official translator, we'll help you get started.

## Updating Errors
Alternatively, if you've noticed an error in one of the translations you can take any of the following avenues:

- Fill out the bug report form
