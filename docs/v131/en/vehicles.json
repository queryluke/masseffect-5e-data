Due to the limited storage space, passengers are limited to what they can carry or store on their bodies.\nTo the rear of this compartment, there is the propulsive drive powered by a mass effect field.</p>\n<p>X3Ms come in a variety of models. Some are smaller with only 1 or 2 seats like the Tess Auburn 2166 aircar. Models\nlike the C-111 Skyline Shuttle are meant for public transportation and can carry up to 10 passengers.
