You learn additional vanguard cantrips of\nyour choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Vanguard table.</p>\n<p>Instead of learning a new cantrip, you may instead learn the advanced version of a cantrip you already know.</p>\n<h3>Power Slots</h3>\n<p>The Vanguard table shows how many power slots you have to cast your powers of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these\nvanguard powers, you must expend a slot of the power’s level or higher. You regain all expended power slots when you finish\na long rest.</p>\n<p>For example, if you know the 1st-level power lance and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level power slot available, you can\ncast lance using either slot.</p>\n<h3>Powers Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you know two 1st-level powers of your choice from the vanguard power list.</p>\n<p>The powers Known column of the Vanguard table shows when you learn more vanguard powers of your choice. Each of these powers\nmust be of a level for which you have power slots. For instance, when you reach 9th level in this class, you can learn\none new power of 1st or 2nd level.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you learn a new power, you may instead choose one of the powers you know and learn an advanced\nversion of it. You select one of the advancement options listed in the power description. Whenever you cast the power,\nyou cast the advanced version of it. You can only learn one advancement for each power.</p>\n<h3>Powercasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Vanguards are outfitted with the L5n biotic implant which draws upon their inner strength of will and focus on their\nphysical mnemonics. As a vanguard, you use your Wisdom whenever a power refers to your powercasting ability. In addition,\nyou use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a biotic power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Power save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Power attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n",
