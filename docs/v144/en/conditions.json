Indoctrination is measured in six levels. For each 24 hour\nperiod a creature spends within the presence of an indoctrinating source, the creature must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw.\nOn a failed save, the creature suffers one level of indoctrination. If an already indoctrinated creature spends another\n24 hour period within the presence of Reaper technology, the DC of the saving throw increases as described below.</p>\n<v-simple-table class=\"mb-8\"><template v-slot:default><thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Next Wisdom DC</th>\n<th>Effect</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>You have difficulty sleeping and constantly have dreams of inky black and oily shadows.

You have disadvantage on all your Charisma-based skill checks.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>You have extreme paranoia. You have disadvantage on all of your Wisdom- and Intelligence-based skill checks.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>You begin to hear voices that issue simple commands. If you do not immediately follow the command, you take 11 (2d10) psychic damage. This damage bypasses shields.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>The voices in your head speak to you often and you begin to agree with what they're saying. You are considered charmed.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>You become a Reaper thrall and lose all control of your character (You are effectively dead).</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</template></v-simple-table><br>\n<h3>Reducing Indoctrination Levels</h3>\n<p>Every long rest that a creature spends outside of the range of an indoctrinating source, it can make a new\nWisdom saving throw (DC based on its current indoctrination level). On a success, reduce its indoctrination level by 1.</p>\n<p>Note: Synthetic creatures are immune to indoctrination.</p>\n<h3>Reaper Tech</h3>\n<p>Usually, indoctrination happens when another creature (such as a reaper, thorian, or leviathan) is actively trying to\nindoctrinate one or many creatures. An exception to this is Reaper technology (i.e., reaper parts or devices salvaged from\nbattle or space). Reaper technology can passively indoctrinate creatures that are merely in the technology's presence.\nDetermining if a creature is within the presence of a piece of Reaper technology is based on the technology's size.\nThe larger the object, the farther the range.</p>\n<h4>Distance of Indoctrination</h4>\n<v-simple-table class=\"mb-8\"><template v-slot:default><thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Size of tech</th>\n<th>Range</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Tiny</td>\n<td><me-distance length=\"30\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Small</td>\n<td><me-distance length=\"100\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td><me-distance length=\"250\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td><me-distance length=\"600\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td><me-distance length=\"6\" large /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td><me-distance length=\"60\" large /></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</template></v-simple-table>",
