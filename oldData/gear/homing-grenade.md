Target a creature you can see within <me-distance length="30" />. The target creature suffers thunder damage (see below). Each other creature
within <me-distance length="5" /> of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers thunder damage
or half as much on a successful one.

The mark of this grenade determines its Save DC, damage, and credits.
