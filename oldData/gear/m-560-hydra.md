As an Attack, choose a creature within <me-distance length="150" /> that you can see and begin targeting. If you
remain targeting until the start of your next turn, fire a unique missile that automatically hits the target .
The missile deploys 3 shaped charges. The first disrupts any barriers or shields, completely removing all barrier ticks
and shield points. The second charge cripples armor; the creature's is reduced by 3 for the next hour. The final charge
explodes and the creature must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save the creature takes 4d12 thunder
damage or half as much on a successful one.
