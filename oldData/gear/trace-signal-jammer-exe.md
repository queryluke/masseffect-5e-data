While this program is Activated, the user is hidden from long-range sensors. You cannot be targeted by any tracking
device that functions by receiving a tracking device's signal, and targeting lasers cannot pinpoint your precise
location, giving you advantage on any saving throws against Heavy Weapons that require Targeting to fire.
