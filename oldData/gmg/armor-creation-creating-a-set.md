An armor set can be one or many pieces of armor. Armor sets are cheaper than creating custom armor, even though they 
may be more powerful. The justification is that an armor set is mass manufactured, so you get more benefits at the
expense of not being able to customize the armor with additional mods.

First, decide the type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) and which pieces it will contain. Then find the base 
cost by using the costs defined in the creating armor table. Next, decide what mechanics (and their potency) you want 
to add to the armor. Calculate the total cost of all your mechanics, add it to the base cost of your armor piece.

Next, you can decide if there are benefits for wearing multiple pieces of the armor. Benefits 
can be mechanics (with a potency) or a unique mechanic. Calculate the total of the of all set bonuses and 
distribute that total evenly across the armor pieces.

Finally, with all costs calculated, reduce the total amount of each armor piece by 15%.

Example:

- Set Bonus (2 of 2)
    - +10 Shields = potency 2 = 10,000 * 2.5 = 25,000
    - +1 AC = potency 1 = 20,000 (_Note that set bonus mechanic costs per potency do not take the other pieces into account_)
    - __Subtotal__: 45,000
    - Divide set bonus by number of pieces: 45,000 / 2 = 22,500
- Set Piece 1
    - Medium Body Armor = 16,000 (Chest = 10,000, Arms = 3,000, Legs = 3,000)
    - Mechanics = AC +2 = potency 2 = 20,000 * 2.5 = 50,000
    - Set Bonus = 22,500
    - Subtotal: 88,500
    - __Total__: 88,500 - (88,500 * .15) =  75,225
- Set Piece 2
    - Medium Head = 5,000
    - Mechanics = Darkvision, toggled as a free action = potency 1 = 2,000 + slight increase for free action = 3,000
    - Set Bonus = 22,500
    - Subtotal: 30,500
    __Total__: 30,500 - (30,500 * .15) =  25,925

When creating armor sets, the cost is just a rule of thumb. If an armor set seems too expensive or cheap, raise or lower the cost to your needs.
