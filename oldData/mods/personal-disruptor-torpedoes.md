Choose a target location within <me-distance length="90" />. Creatures within a
<me-distance length="10" /> of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature
takes 3d12 force damage, or have as much damage on a successful one. You must finish a short rest,
allowing the weapon to recharge before using it again.
