This weapons heat becomes a die, based on its current heat. 1-4: d4, 5-6: d6, 7-8: d8, 9-10: d10, 11+: d12. Whenever you make a ranged attack with the weapon, spin down the die 1 face. If you make a Burst Fire attack, spin down the die 2 faces instead. Every round that you don't fire the weapon, spin the die up 1 face. This represents the weapon internally cooling off. If you ever spin down the die to 0, the weapon jams and cannot be fired again this combat.
