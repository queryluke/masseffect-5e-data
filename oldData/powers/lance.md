Release a lance of energy at a creature within range. Make a ranged power attack against the target. On a hit, the target
takes force damage equal to 3d8 + your powercasting ability modifier.

__At Higher Levels__: When you cast this power using a power slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 2d8
for each slot level above the 1st.
