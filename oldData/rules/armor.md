To survive in the galaxy, your character needs to wear armor. Not only does armor abate damage from extremely powerful,
futuristic weapons but armor also supplies __shield points__, also called shields.

### Armor Stats

__Armor Proficiency__. Just like 5th edition, anyone can put on armor. However, only those proficient in the armor type
know how to wear it effectively. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor (light, medium, or heavy).
If you are wearing 2 or more pieces of armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check,
saving throw, or Attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity. If you are wearing 4 pieces of armor you lack
proficiency with, you cannot cast powers.

__Armor Class (AC)__. Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor you wear determines your base Armor Class.

__Shield Points__. All armor chest pieces provide some amount of shield points.
See the [Combat > Shields](/manual/combat#shields) for more information.

__Consumable Capacities__. All armor has slots and hidden compartments for mission-critical gear: 10 thermal clips, 4 medi-gel, and 2 grenades.
The armor will indicate if it has an increase in any of these capacities. Armor mods can also increase these capacities.

### Mix & Match <v-chip color="info" small>new</v-chip>
Unlike D&D 5th edition, armor in Mass Effect 5e can be mixed between armor placements on the body. There are 4 armor placements:
__Head__, __Chest__, __Arms__, and __Legs__.

Your base AC is 10 and each piece of armor provides an AC bonus depending on its type and placement as listed in
the Armor / AC table.

|__Armor / AC__||||
| Placement/Type | Light | Medium | Heavy |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Chest | +1 AC | +2 AC | +3 AC |
| Arms | No bonus | +1 AC | +2 AC |
| Legs | No bonus | +1 AC | +2 AC |
| Head | Unless otherwise listed, headware provides no bonus to AC. |||

Additionally, there are bonuses and limitations for the combination of armor types you are wearing,
explained in the Armor Bonuses and Limitations table.

|__Armor Bonuses and Limitations__||||
| If you are wearing... | Dexterity Bonus to AC | Strength | Stealth |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 3+ pieces of Heavy armor | - | Str 16 | Disadvantage |
| 2 pieces of Heavy armor | - | Str 15 | Disadvantage |
| 1 piece of Heavy armor | - | Str 13 | Disadvantage |
| 3+ pieces of Medium armor | Max +2 | Str 13 | Disadvantage
| 2 pieces of Medium armor | Max +2 | Str 12 | - |
| 1 piece of Medium armor | Max +2 | - | - |
| Light or no armor | + Dex modifier | - | - |
| _Body Armor is considered three pieces (arms, chest, and legs)_ |||

__Body Armor__. Body armor is a special type of armor piece that consists of 3 pieces of armor: Chest, Arms, and Legs. Body
armor is completely integrated (all or none), therefore, you cannot swap out pieces from other sets. I.e., if you're
wearing the Duelist body armor, you cannot replace the legs from it with the Lockdown Greaves. This rule is, of course, flexible,
as GMs might allow this type of tinkering in exchange for time, credits, and/or skill checks.

__Heavier Armor__. Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the
Armor Bonuses and Limitations table shows “Str 12” or “Str 16” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor
reduces the wearer’s speed by <me-distance length="10" /> unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

For simplicity's sake, you cannot mix armor *within* placements. I.e., you cannot have a heavy piece of on your right arm
and a light piece of armor on your left.

### Variant: Encumbrance
If you are using the [Variant: Encumbrance](/manual/using-ability-scores#strength) rules,
use the Armor Piece Weights table to determine the total weight of the armor you're wearing.

|Placement/Type|Light|Medium|Heavy|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Chest|3kg|6kg|10kg|
|Arms|1kg|2kg|3kg|
|Legs|1kg|2kg|3kg|
|Head|All headware weighs 2kg|||

### Set Bonuses
Some armor can provide a set bonus, which are additional benefits you receive from wearing multiple pieces from the same set, signifying the armors
component pieces working together for a unified integration. Armor with the same base name is part of a set, e.g. the __Colossus__ greaves, chestplate,
gauntlets, and helmet are all part of the Colossus set.

If an armor piece is part of a set and has a set bonus, each armor piece will indicate the bonus you receive from wearing
a certain number of items in that set. _Note: You only receive the benefit once per set_ and the benefit ends immediately if you fall below the threshold.

:::alert
__SET BONUS EXAMPLE__

Medium armor with a set bonus of...
- Set Bonus (2 of 4): +1 AC
- Set Bonus (4 of 4): +1 AC

If you are wearing the head and chest pieces, you gain +0 AC from the helmet and +2 AC from the chest piece (as calculated
using the Armor / AC table). In addition you gain +1 AC from wearing 2 pieces of the set. Note, you _do not_ gain +1 AC
for the head _and_ +1 AC for the chest. As soon as you remove either the helmet or the chest
apiece, you loose the +1 AC bonus from the set.

### Environmental Protection <v-chip color="info" small>new</v-chip>
All armor provides basic environmental protection from the vacuum of space or hazardous atmospheres. Armor supplies enough
air and heat to the wearer for 8 hours of activity or 16 hours if the operative remains motionless. Your GM may require
that your character wear a helmet to gain this benefit, or they may use the __bubble rule__ and claim that all armor suits
can cast an energy "bubble" around your characters head to keep air in and the environment out.

### Getting Into and Out of Armor
The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor's category.

__Don__. This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor's AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.

__Doff__. This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half.

Category | Don | Doff
--- | --- | ---
Light Armor | 1 minute | 1 minute
Medium Armor | 5 minutes | 1 minute
Heavy Armor | 10 minutes | 5 minutes
