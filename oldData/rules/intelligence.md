Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.

### Intelligence Checks

An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The
Electronics, Engineering, History, Investigation, and Science skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks (see [Appendix > Skills](/appendix/skills)).

- __*Other Intelligence Checks*__. The GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
  - Estimate the value of a piece of tech
  - Create a false ID badge
  - Forge an electronic document
  - Recall lore about an ancient civilization
  - Win a game of skill

### Powercasting Ability
Engineers, infiltrators, and sentinels use Intelligence as their powercasting ability, which helps determine the saving
throw DCs of powers they cast.
