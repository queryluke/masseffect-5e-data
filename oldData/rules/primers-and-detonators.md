Primers and Detonators add a combo-based mechanic to combat. However, they can also add an unwanted level of complexity
as tracking which creatures are primed at any given moment can become cumbersome. Therefore you may forego this rule
and ignore any mention of the Primed condition or detonation effects.

Some powers and attacks cause the target to become __primed__ as indicated in its power text. Some powers can detonate
primed targets. These powers are marked so on their power cards. When a primed target is hit with a detonating power or
attack the primed condition ends and the detonation causes an explosive effect outlined in the Primed Condition below.

There are five primed types: Force, Necrotic, Fire, Cold, or Lightning each with its own unique detonating effect.

A creature can suffer from multiple primed types simultaneously as long as each type is different. When detonated, all
explosions happen at once centered on the location of the primed target. The GM decides which effects happen in which order.
