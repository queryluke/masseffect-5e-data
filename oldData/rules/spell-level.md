### Power Level
Every power has a level from 0 to 5. A power's level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the
lowly (but still impressive) lance at 1st level and the earth-shaking Storm at 4th. __Cantrips__ - simple but powerful powers
that characters can cast almost by rote - are level 0. The higher a power's level, the higher level a powercaster must
be to use that power. All combat powers are considered cantrips.

Power level and character level don't correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level,
not 5th level, to cast a 5th-level power.

### Combat Cantrips <v-chip color="info" small>new</v-chip>
Combat powers are a special type of cantrip, that are more powerful than biotic cantrips. Combat powers have limitations
in the number of times you can use them per short and long rest. Certain classes (infiltrators and vanguards) have the
option of learning combat powers instead of cantrips, as indicated in their class descriptions.

Many Combat powers have an action cost of Attack. This means you must use the Attack combat action to cast the power. If
a power or effect prevents you from taking the Attack action, you cannot cast the power.
