title: Starting Equipment
section: equipment
order: 1
---
When you create your character, you receive equipment based on a combination of your class and background. Alternatively,
you can start with a number of credits based on your class and spend them on items from the equipment section. See
the Starting Wealth by Class table to determine how many credits you have to spend.
for more information on using racial starting credits.

You decide how your character came by this starting equipment. It might have been an inheritance or goods that the
character purchased during his or her upbringing. You might have been equipped with a weapon, armor, and a backpack as
part of military service. You might even have stolen your gear. A weapon could be a family heirloom, passed down from
generation to generation until your character finally took up the mantle and followed in an ancestorâ€™s space faring footsteps.
