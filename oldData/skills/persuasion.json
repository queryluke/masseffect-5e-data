  "description": "When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a politician to let your party see the councilor, negotiating peace between warring krogan tribes, or inspiring a crowd of colonist."
