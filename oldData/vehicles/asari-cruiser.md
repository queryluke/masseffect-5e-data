A mix-up during the cruiser's design left it with an unusually large drive core and engineers redesigned the ship
around the excessive power source. The asari cruiser's unusually robust engines provide enough energy to generate kinetic
barriers normally reserved for dreadnoughts.

__Additional Systems__: The asari cruiser has an Armory, GARDIAN system, Medbay, and Exonet.
