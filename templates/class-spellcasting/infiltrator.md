### Preparing and casting spells
The Infiltrator table shows how many tech points you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these
infiltrator spells, you must expend a number of tech points equal to the spellâ€™s level or higher. You regain all
expended tech points when you finish a long rest.

You are limited in the number of tech points you can spend to power a spell as indicated in the Tech Point Limit column
of the Infiltrator table.

For example, a 9th-level infiltrator can cast spells for 1 or 2 tech points.

You prepare the list of infiltrator spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the infiltrator spell list.
When you do so, choose a number of infiltrator spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your infiltrator level
(minimum of one spell).

You may prepare the advanced version of a spell for the cost of 2 regular versions. You may only prepare one advanced
version for each spell.

For example, if you are a 9th-level infiltrator with an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can be one of the following:

- seven regular spells
- one advanced spell and five regular spells,
- two advanced spells and three regular spells,
- three advanced spells and one regular spell

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of infiltrator spells
requires time spent to program them into your omni-tool: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### Spellcasting Ability

Infiltrators use a highly modified Omni-tool that requires a keen intellect to maintain. As an Infiltrator, you use your
Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when
setting the saving throw DC for a tech spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

__Spell save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

__Spell attack modifier__ = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
