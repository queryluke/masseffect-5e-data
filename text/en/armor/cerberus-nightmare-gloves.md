Nightmare armor is worn by Cerberus Phantoms expecting long-range conflicts. Powerful capacitors deliver punishing energy to the Phantom's weapons, and circulating coolant in its gloves allows for more shots before a given thermal clip overheats. The remaining energy focuses on shield strength and regeneration time to help survivability.
