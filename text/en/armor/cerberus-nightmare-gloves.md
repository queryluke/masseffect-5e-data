name: Cerberus Nightmare Gloves
flavor: >-
  Nightmare armor is worn by Cerberus Phantoms expecting long-range conflicts.
  Powerful capacitors deliver punishing energy to the Phantom's weapons, and
  circulating coolant in its gloves allows for more shots before a given thermal
  clip overheats. The remaining energy focuses on shield strength and
  regeneration time to help survivability.

- Equipped weapons have increased heat equal to twice the weapon's base heat.
