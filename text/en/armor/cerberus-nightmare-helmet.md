Nightmare armor is worn by Cerberus Phantoms expecting long-range conflicts. Powerful capacitors 
deliver punishing energy to the Phantom's weapons, and circulating coolant in its gloves allows for 
more shots before a given thermal clip overheats. The remaining energy focuses on shield strength 
and regeneration time to help survivability.
