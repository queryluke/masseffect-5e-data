Cerberus Shade armor is worn by Phantoms who need to be prepared for a wide variety of threats. Its 
capacitors give modest boosts to shields and shield regeneration time. Many small improvements 
increase the performance of biotic amps and omni-tools, heat management and kinetic coils for ranged 
weapons, and synthetic muscle assistors for melee capability.
