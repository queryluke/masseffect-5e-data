The Andromeda Initiative's mission is one of discovery and exploration, as well as colonization. Readying personnel to journey into harsh environments-and even the void of space was always part of the plan. Thus, the Initiative's custom Deep Space Explorer (DSE) hardsuit is equipped with multiple environment seals, failsafes, a hefty liquid oxygen supply, a formidable kinetic barrier generator, and an array of scientific instruments. Although many were built, most were mysteriously lost en route to Andromeda.
