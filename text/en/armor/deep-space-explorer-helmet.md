name: Deep Space Explorer Helmet
flavor: >-
  The Andromeda Initiative's mission is one of discovery and exploration, as
  well as colonization. Readying personnel to journey into harsh
  environments-and even the void of space was always part of the plan. Thus, the
  Initiative's custom Deep Space Explorer (DSE) hardsuit is equipped with
  multiple environment seals, failsafes, a hefty liquid oxygen supply, a
  formidable kinetic barrier generator, and an array of scientific instruments.
  Although many were built, most were mysteriously lost en route to Andromeda.
