name: Duelist Armor
flavor: >-
  Duelist armor was originally commissioned to Elanus Risk Control systems for
  use in cage fighting and other live-action combat sports. The armor focuses on
  keeping the wearer alive after a fatal wound because managers were tired of
  losing so many fighters in the ring. The armor is as light as fabric and
  allows full range of motion.
