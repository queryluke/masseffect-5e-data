Built specifically for Cerberus field officers, the Inferno armor has a VI dedicated to recognizing 
signs of stress and medical trauma. This application helps assess soldiers but can be useful in any 
high-risk situations. The Inferno's microframe computer also manages biotic amp and omni-tool power, 
and microservos help the wearer's movements to counteract the armor's weight.
