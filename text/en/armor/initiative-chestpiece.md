Standard-issue Andromeda Initiative hardsuits are designed for exploration as much as combat, 
combining jump-jets, high-grade external and internal sensors, and a variety of atmospheric filters 
with the usual kinetic barrier generators and ceramic armor plating. Personnel equipped in these 
suits can enter and leave alien biomes without fear of contamination or hostile wildlife.
