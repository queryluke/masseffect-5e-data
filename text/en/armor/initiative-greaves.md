  - Your jump distance is tripled. If you jump straight up, you can hover at the
    apex of your jump until the start of your next turn, at which point, you
    fall slowly back to the ground, taking half of your movement speed for this
    turn.

Standard-issue Andromeda Initiative hardsuits are designed for exploration as much as combat, combining jump-jets, high-grade external and internal sensors, and a variety of atmospheric filters with the usual kinetic barrier generators and ceramic armor plating. Personnel equipped in these suits can enter and leave alien biomes without fear of contamination or hostile wildlife.
