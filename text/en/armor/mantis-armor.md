- Whenever you hit a target with a melee weapon attack, you may use your reaction to activate your 
armor's switchblades, dealing an additional 1d6 slashing damage to the target. If you use your 
reaction this way, you may then use your bonus action to attempt to grapple the target. You have 
advantage on the Strength (Athletics) check.
