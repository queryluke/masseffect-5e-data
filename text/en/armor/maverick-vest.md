There's nothing elegant about this patchwork hardsuit. It mixes various materials and technology from the Heleus Cluster and its microframe computer runs a jumble of barely linked programs. Despite this, or because of it, the armor is highly effective in combat, with targeting and thermal distribution systems second to none.
