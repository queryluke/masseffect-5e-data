  There's nothing elegant about this patchwork hardsuit. It mixes various
  materials and technology from the Heleus Cluster and its microframe computer
  runs a jumble of barely linked programs. Despite this, or because of it, the
  armor is highly effective in combat, with targeting and thermal distribution
  systems second to none.
