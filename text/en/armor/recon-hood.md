A hood issued to covert action teams, this model's optic display interfaces with most small arm's 
auto-targeting software, linking hand and eye for improved accuracy and increased weapon damage. 
Ballistic-mesh fabric and composite ceramic plating provide necessary armor, and the integral air 
filter helps in hostile environments.
