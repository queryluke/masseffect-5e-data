This armor was designed from scratch by the Initiative using Remnant technology. Its servos, microframe computer, and kinetic barrier generators are all dependent on Remnant science and artifacts. This resilient and regenerative hardsuit has an energy surplus, though its internal systems can be difficult to properly monitor.
