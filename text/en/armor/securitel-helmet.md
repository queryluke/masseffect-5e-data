The Securitel Helmet was originally designed as riot-gear. It is covered in ablative plating, well-padded to lessen damage from shocks, blows and bullet impacts. The helmet's emitters boost shielding in the rest of the armor, while its onboard computers monitor the wearer's heart-rate and central nervous system.
