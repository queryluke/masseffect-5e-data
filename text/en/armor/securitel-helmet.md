name: Securitel Helmet
flavor: >-
  The Securitel Helmet was originally designed as riot-gear. It is covered in
  ablative plating, well-padded to lessen damage from shocks, blows and bullet
  impacts. The helmet's emitters boost shielding in the rest of the armor, while
  its onboard computers monitor the wearer's heart-rate and central nervous
  system.
