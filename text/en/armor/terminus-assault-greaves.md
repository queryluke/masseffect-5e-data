The Terminus Armor is environmentally sealed with an independent air supply for use in space and 
extreme planetary conditions. Its onboard microframe computer runs a suite of battle management 
software. To prevent detection by passive thermal sensors, body heat is channeled to the base of the 
feet and dispersed into the ground.
