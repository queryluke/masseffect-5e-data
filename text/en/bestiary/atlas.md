        The atlas targets an area within <me-distance length='150' />. Each
        creature within <me-distance length='15' /> of the target must make a DC
        18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 52 (8d12)
        thunder damage or half as much damage on a successful one.

        The atlas targets an area within <me-distance length="25" />. A cloud of
        thick smoke erupts out in a <me-distance length="10" adj/> cube centered
        on the target location. The cloud's area is heavily obscured and
        persists for 30 seconds. A moderate wind (<me-distance length="11" large
        num-only /> to <me-distance length="20" large /> per hour) can disperse
        the smoke after 1 round, and a strong wind (<me-distance length="21"
        large num-only override="or more {metric}"/> per hour) can do so
        immediately.
