        The vorcha regains 4 hit points at the start of its turn. If the vorcha
        takes fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the
        vorcha's next turn. The vorcha dies only if it starts its turn with 0
        hit points and doesn't regenerate.

        Choose a creature within <me-distance length='150' /> that you can see
        and fire a missile at it. Each creature within a <me-distance
        length='10' adj /> cube of the target, including the target, must make a
        DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save a creature takes 39
        (6d12) thunder damage or half as much on a successful one.
