        As a bonus action, the centurion can activate its Tech Armor. It
        immediately gains 20 temporary hit points. While the centurion has at

        When the centurion hits with its M-27 Scimitar, if the target is primed,
        the target detonates. Otherwise, the target becomes primed: lightning
        until the end of the centurion's next turn.
