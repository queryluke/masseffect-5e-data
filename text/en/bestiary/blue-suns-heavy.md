        Choose a creature within <me-distance length='150' /> that you can see
        and fire a missile at it. Each creature within a <me-distance
        length='10' adj /> cube of the target, including the target, must make a
        DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save a creature takes 39
        (6d12) thunder damage or half as much on a successful one.
