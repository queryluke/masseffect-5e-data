        As a bonus action, the legionnaire can activate its Tech Armor. It
        immediately gains 10 temporary hit points. While the legionnaire has at
        least 1 of these temporary hit points remaining, it has +2 AC.

        When the legionnaire hits with its M-15 Vindicator, if the target is
        primed, the target detonates. Otherwise, the target becomes primed:
        lightning until the end of the legionnaire's next turn.
