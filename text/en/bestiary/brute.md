        If the brute moves at least <me-distance length='15' /> straight toward
        a target and then hits it with a smash attack on the same turn, the
        target takes an extra 7 (2d6) damage. If the target is a creature, it
        must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
