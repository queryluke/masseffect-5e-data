        The centurion targets an area within <me-distance length="25" />. Each
        creature within <me-distance length="10" /> of the target must make a DC
        13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d12
        piercing damage or half as much damage on a successful one.
    smoke-grenade:
      name: Smoke Grenade
      text: >-
        The centurion targets an area within <me-distance length="25" />. A
        cloud of thick smoke erupts out in a <me-distance length="10" adj/> cube
        centered on the target location. The cloud's area is heavily obscured
        and persists for 30 seconds. A moderate wind (<me-distance length="11"
        large num-only /> to <me-distance length="20" large /> per hour) can
        disperse the smoke after 1 round, and a strong wind (<me-distance
        length="21" large num-only override="or more {metric}"/> per hour) can
        do so immediately.
