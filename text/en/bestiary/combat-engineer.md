        The combat engineer is equipped with 1 Turret (see Bestiary). As an
        action, the combat engineer can deploy the Turret on a level surface
        within <me-distance length='5' />. The Turret is controlled by the
        combat engineer and takes its turn at the end of the combat engineer's
        turn. The combat engineer can use an action to stow the Turret, placing
        it at another location with a subsequent action.
