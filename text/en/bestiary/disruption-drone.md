        When the disruption drone drops to 0 hit points it explodes. Each
        creature within a <me-distance length='5' /> radius must make a DC 13
        Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 13 (2d12)
        thunder damage, or half as much on a successful one.

        The disruption can use its action to immediately reduce its hit points
        to 0.
