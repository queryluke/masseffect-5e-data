        Each creature of the harvester's choice that is within <me-distance
        length='150' /> of the name and aware of it must succeed on a DC 19
        Wisdom saving throw or become {frightened} for 1 minute. A creature can
        repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
        effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is
        successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the
        harvester's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
