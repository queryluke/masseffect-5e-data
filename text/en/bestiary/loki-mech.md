      name: Chatter (variant)

        The LOKI mech can be programmed with pre-recorded phrases, which it
        utters occasionally during combat. Each hostile creature that hears the
        phrase much pass a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature becomes
        unnerved by the phrase and can only target the LOKI mech when making
        attack rolls or using damaging powers. On a success, a creature is
        unaffected and is immune to the LOKI mech's Chatter. The DC of the
        saving throw is dependant on the phrase, but cannot be higher than 12.
