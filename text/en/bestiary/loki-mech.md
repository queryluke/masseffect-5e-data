    - name: Chatter (variant)
      text: >-
        The LOKI mech can be programmed with pre-recorded phrases, which it
        utters occasionally during combat. Each hostile creature that hears the
        phrase much pass a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature becomes
        unnerved by the phrase and can only target the LOKI mech when making
        attack rolls or using damaging powers. On a success, a creature is
        unaffected and is immune to the LOKI mech's Chatter. The DC of the
        saving throw is dependant on the phrase, but cannot be higher than 12.

        The LOKI mech is incapable of complex combat tactics. It never seeks

        damage.
