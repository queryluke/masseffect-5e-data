        During its first turn, the N7 Shadow has advantage on attack rolls
        against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the N7 Shadow
        scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.

        If the N7 Shadow is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a
        Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the N7 Shadow instead
        takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage
        if it fails.

        a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or
        when the target is within <me-distance length='5' /> of an ally of the
        N7 Shadow that isn't incapacitated and the N7 Shadow doesn't have
        disadvantage on the attack roll.
