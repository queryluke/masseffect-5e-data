        During its first turn, the N7 Shadow has advantage on attack rolls
        against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the N7 Shadow
        scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.

      text: >-
        If the N7 Shadow is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a
        Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the N7 Shadow instead
        takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage
        if it fails.

        Once per turn, the N7 Shadow deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when it hits
        a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or
        when the target is within <me-distance length='5' /> of an ally of the
        N7 Shadow that isn't incapacitated and the N7 Shadow doesn't have
        disadvantage on the attack roll.

        As a bonus action, the N7 Shadow activates its tactical cloak, becoming
