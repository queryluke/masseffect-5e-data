    - name: Particle Beam
      text: >-
        The oculus fires a persistent particle beam that is <me-distance
        length='60' /> long and <me-distance length='5' /> wide that lasts until
        the start of the oculus's next turn. While firing the beam, the oculus's
        speed becomes 0. Each creature that is within the beam's path or that
        moves into the beam's path for the first time on its turn must make a DC
        16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 66
        (12d10) radiant damage, or half as much on a successful save.
