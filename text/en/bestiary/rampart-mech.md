    - name: Tactical Cloak
      text: >-
        As a bonus action, the rampart mech activates its tactical cloak,
        becoming invisible for 1 minute. When the rampart mech makes a melee or
        ranged attack or uses a tech or combat power, tactical cloak ends.

        When the rampart mech dies, it vents excess heat from its weapon and
        armor in a <me-distance length='5' /> radius until the start of its next
        turn. Each creature that enters the radius for the first time or ends
        its turn there takes 18 (4d8) radiant damage.
