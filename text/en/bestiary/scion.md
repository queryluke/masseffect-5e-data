        The scion targets three locations within <me-distance length='90' /> and
        launches an explosive blast to each. The locations can be the same or
        different. Each creature within a <me-distance length='15' /> radius of
        a target location must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
        save a creature takes 15 (3d10) thunder damage or half as much on a
        successful one.
