        Rather than wearing armor, the Synthetic beast has an armor type of choice. (See Geth for rules on this.)
        Medium and Heavy armor do not have their strength requirements. The Synthetic beast has an amount of mod slots equal to the Tracker's PB.

        Due to their inherent customization, you may choose 1 Training Regimen from the list. It may not have a
