        The nymph releases spores in a <me-distance length='10' adj />-radius
        sphere lasting until the end of its next turn. A creature that enters
        the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 3
        (1d6) psychic damage and must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a
        failed save, a creature becomes paralyzed until the start of its next
        turn.

In its juvenile stage, the Thorian becomes mobile and sneaks aboard unknowing ships to spread across 
the galaxy.
