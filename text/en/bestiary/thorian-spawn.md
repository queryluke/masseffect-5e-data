        lasting until the end of its next turn. A creature that enters the area
        for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 3 (1d6)
        psychic damage and must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
        save, a creature becomes paralyzed until the start of its next turn.
