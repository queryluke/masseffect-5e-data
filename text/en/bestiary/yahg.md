        During its first turn, the yahg has advantage on attack rolls against
        any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the yahg scores against a
        surprised creature is a critical hit.

        If the yahg subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw
        to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on
        the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

        The yahg  deals an extra 13 (4d6) damage when it hits a target with a
        weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target
        is within <me-distance length='5' /> of an ally of the yahg that isn't
        incapacitated and the yahg doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
