        When the YMIR mech is reduced to 0 hit points, it self-destructs. Each
        creature within a <me-distance length='15' adj />-radius sphere must
        make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes
        22 (4d10) thunder damage or half as much on a successful one.
