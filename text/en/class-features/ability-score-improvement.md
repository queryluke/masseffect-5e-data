name: Ability Score Improvement

At {{ level }} level, and again at {{ addLevels }}, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you
can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.
