name: Biotic Mastery
---
At 17th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain biotics that you can cast them at will. Choose two 1st-level
biotic powers that you have learned. You can cast those powers at 1st level without
expending a power slot. If you want to cast either power at a higher level, you must expend a power slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours training, you can exchange one or both of the powers you chose for different powers of the same levels.
