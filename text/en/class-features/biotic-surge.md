name: Biotic Surge
---
Starting at 6th level, you can empower your biotics that unleash harm on groups of foes. When you force multiple
creatures to make saving throws against the damage of one of your powers, you can increase the power's damage by rolling
two more of its damage dice. This increase occurs only on the turn you cast the power.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
