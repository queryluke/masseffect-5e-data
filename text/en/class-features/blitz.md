Starting at 18th level, whenever a creature within <me-distance length="50" /> that you can see makes a weapon attack or casts a power, you can use your reaction to
cast charge, targeting that creature. Resolve any effects caused by charge before the creature takes its action. The creature
may choose to make a different action this turn.
