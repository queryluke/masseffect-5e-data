By 7th level, you've learned to never let your guard down. You have advantage on initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your
first turn, but only if you activate your tactical focus, selecting an area that encompasses your location, before doing
anything else on that turn.
