### Preparing and casting powers
The Engineer table shows how many tech points you have to cast your powers of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these
engineer powers, you must expend a number of tech points equal to the powerâ€™s level or higher. You regain all
expended tech points when you finish a long rest.

You are limited in the number of tech points you can spend to power a power as indicated in the Tech Point Limit column
of the Engineer table.

For example, a 9th-level engineer can cast powers for 1, 2, or 3 tech points.

You prepare the list of engineer powers that are available for you to cast, choosing from the engineer power list.
When you do so, choose a number of engineer powers equal to your Intelligence modifier + your engineer level
(minimum of one power).

You may prepare the advanced version of a power for the cost of 2 regular versions. You may only prepare one advanced
version for each power.

For example, if you are a 4th-level engineer with an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared powers can be one of the following:

- seven regular powers
- one advanced power and five regular powers,
- two advanced powers and three regular powers,
- three advanced powers and one regular power

You can also change your list of prepared powers when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of engineer powers
requires time spent to program them into your omni-tool: at least 1 minute per power level for each power on your list.

### Powercasting Ability

Engineers use a highly modified Omni-tool that requires a keen intellect to maintain. As an engineer, you use your
Intelligence whenever a power refers to your powercasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when
setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

__Power save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

__Power attack modifier__ = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
