### Cantrips
You know two cantrips of your choice from the sentinel power list. You learn additional sentinel cantrips of your choice
at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Sentinel table.

Instead of learning a new cantrip, you may instead learn the advanced version of a cantrip you already know.

### Power Slots
The Sentinel table shows how many power slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of
your power slots are the same level. To cast one of your sentinel powers of 1st level or higher, you must expend a power
slot. You regain all expended power slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 2nd-level power slots. To cast the 1st-level power lance, you must spend
one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level power.

### Powers Known of 1st Level and Higher
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level powers of your choice from the sentinel power list.

The powers Known column of the Sentinel table shows when you learn more sentinel powers of your choice of 1st level
and higher. A power you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your
level. When you reach 5th level, for example, you learn a new sentinel power, which can be 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you learn a new power, you may instead choose one of the powers you know and learn an advanced
version of it. You select one of the advancement options listed in the power description. Whenever you cast the power,
you cast the advanced version of it. You can only learn one advancement for each power.

### Powercasting Ability

Sentinels use a unique L5t biotic implant that integrates with the operative's omni-tool maximizes their innate talents.
As a sentinel you choose either Intelligence or Wisdom as your powercasting modifier.

- Choosing Intelligence means that your operative takes advantage of their omni-tool, using it to assist in the casting
  of biotic powers. Their keen intellect helps them choose strategic targets to maximize the potency of their powers.
- Choosing Wisdom means that your operative has unmatched concentration and can use the physical mnemonics of their
  biotic implant to cast tech powers with their omni-tool. Their patience and insight maximizes the potency of their powers.

You use your selected ability whenever a power refers to your powercasting ability. In addition, you use your selected
ability's modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

__Power save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your selected ability modifier

__Power attack modifier__ = your proficiency bonus + your selected ability modifier
