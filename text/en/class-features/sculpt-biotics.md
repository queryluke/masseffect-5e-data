Starting at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your biotic powers. When you
cast a biotic power that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1+ the
power's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the power, and they take no
damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.
