Adepts are biotic specialists, capable of disabling and killing enemies with raw biotic power. While they lack
advanced combat training, they are the best at defeating enemies without firing a shot. They are outfitted with L5x
implants that can spawn a micro-singularity, damaging enemies and pulling them into the air.
