While infiltrators may excel at taking down high priority sapient targets, Trackers are experts at finding all sorts of
other prey. Be it footprints, remains of their food, scratches or markings on trees or whatever else, they are
relentless when it comes to finding whatever beast, or man, it is they are pursuing.
