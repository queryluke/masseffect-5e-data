* When a primed creature is hit with a power or ability that __detonates__, the primed condition explodes, resulting
in one of the following effects. After resolving the effect, the primed condition ends.
* A creature can be primed with multiple types at once. When detonated, the order in which the effects are resolved is random (the GM can roll a dice to determine the order or resolution).
* At higher levels, the effect of the explosion changes. This increase is based on the level of creature who caused the primed condition.
