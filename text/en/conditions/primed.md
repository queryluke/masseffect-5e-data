name: Primed

* When a primed creature is hit with a power or ability that __detonates__, the primed condition explodes, resulting
in one of the following effects. After resolving the effect, the primed condition ends.
* A creature can be primed with multiple types at once. When detonated, the order in which the effects are resolved is random (the GM can roll a dice to determine the order or resolution).
* At higher levels, the effect of the explosion changes. This increase is based on the level of creature who caused the primed condition.

__Force.__ When a creature that is primed: force detonates, it suffers 2d6 force damage, is knocked back
<me-distance length="15" /> and becomes prone. The force damage increases by 1d6 at 5th (3d6), 11th (4d6), and 17th (5d6) level.

__Necrotic.__ When a creature that is primed: necrotic detonates, it suffers 1d12 necrotic damage and must succeed on a
DC 13 Constitution saving throw or becomes stunned until the end of its next turn. The necrotic damage increases
by 1d12 at 5th (2d12), 11th (3d12), and 17th (4d12) level.

__Fire.__ Each creature within a <me-distance length="10" adj /> radius, including the primed target, catch fire,
taking 1d6 fire damage. Each creature continues to burn for 1 minute, taking 1d6 fire damage at the start of its
turn. A creature that is on fire can use its action put out the fire. The fire damage increases by 1d6 at 5th (2d6),
11th (3d6), and 17th (4d6) level.

__Cold.__ Each creature within a <me-distance length="10" adj /> radius, including the primed target, must pass a
DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save a creature is frozen until the end of its next turn. The DC of the saving
throw increases by 1 at 5th (16), 11th (17), and 17th (18) level.
