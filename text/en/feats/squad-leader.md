name: Squad Leader
note: Heal and inspire allies to overcome negative conditions.

You know just what to say in a tight situation.

As a bonus action, you can inspire all allies within earshot to instantly roll a hit die and regain that many hit
points. This does not expend a hit die from their pool. Allies immediately recover from the following
conditions: <me-condition id="charmed" />, <me-condition id="frightened" />, <me-condition id="incapacitated" />,
<me-condition id="paralyzed" />, <me-condition id="poisoned" />, <me-condition id="prone" />,
<me-condition id="restrained" />, and <me-condition id="stunned" />. You
may use this ability once per long rest.
