name: M-920 Cain

As an Attack, choose a location within <me-distance length="300" /> and begin targeting. If you remain targeting until
the start of your next turn, you can choose to continue targeting, consuming another charge, or you may use an Attack
to fire the Cain. When fired, any creature within <me-distance length="5" /> of the target location automatically fails
the saving throw. Creatures within <me-distance length="30" /> of the target make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw.
On a failed save, a creature takes X + 5d12 radiant damage where X is the number of charges you used multiplied by 2.
On a success, a creature takes half damage.
