As an Attack, choose a creature within <me-distance length="150" /> that you can see and begin targeting. If
you remain targeting until the start of your next turn, fire a missile at the target. Each creature within a
<me-distance length="10" adj /> cube centered on the target must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save a
creature takes 6d12 thunder damage or half as much on a successful one.
