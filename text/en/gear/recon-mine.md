name: Recon Mine
---
Launch a recon mine to a location of your choice within <me-distance length="30" />. It first sticks to the target
location then scans creatures within a <me-distance length="30" adj/> cone, relaying tactical weak points about the creature's
armor and location. After your turn ends, any hostile creature that walks through the scanning cone suffers a penalty to
its AC and cannot benefit from being <me-condition id="invisible"/>. Each creature can only be affected by this penalty once.

A creature can spot the mine with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception).

To disarm the mine, a creature must pass an Intelligence (Electronics) check. If the check fails, the mine detonates, and
the creature that made the check automatically fails its saving throw. Additionally, a successful ranged attack on the
mine (AC 10) will detonate it. You may also use a bonus action on your turn to detonate the mine.

When the mine detonates, each creature within a <me-distance length="5" adj/>-radius sphere centred on the mine must
make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. A creature suffers thunder damage (see below) on a failed save
or half as much damage on a successful one.

The mark of this mine determines the DC of its AC penalty, Intelligence (Electronics) check, damage, and credits.
