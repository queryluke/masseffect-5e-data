name: Sticky Grenade
---
Target an area within <me-distance length="25" />. At the beginning of your next turn, creatures within
<me-distance length="10" /> of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers
thunder damage (see below) or half as much damage on a successful one.

With a sticky grenade, you may choose to make a melee weapon attack on a target creature within
<me-distance length="5" /> instead, or a ranged weapon attack on a target creature within <me-distance length="25" />.
Add your Dexterity modifier to the attack. Do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack unless you have the
Grenadier feat. On a hit, the grenade hits and sticks to the target, and when it explodes, the target automatically
fails its saving throw. On a miss, the grenade lands within <me-distance length="5" /> of the target.

The mark of this grenade determines its Save DC, damage, and cost.
