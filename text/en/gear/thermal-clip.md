name: Thermal Clip

>It was discovered that, in an age of kinetic barriers, most firefights were won by the side who could put the most
rounds downrange the fastest. As such, detachable heat sinks, known as thermal clips, were adopted first by the geth,
and shortly thereafter by organic arms manufacturers. Ammunition may never be a concern with modern arms, but the
availability of thermal clips is; weapons without thermal clips have nowhere to disperse their heat and are incapable of
firing. Luckily, thermal clips litter modern battlefields and can be obtained from fallen enemies or found around the
environment.

__Use.__ You use a thermal clip when you take the [Reload](/manual/combat#actions-in-combat) action.

:::alert
Because thermal clips are so easily attainable, GMs might find it more manageable to simply not keep track of
thermal clips and assume players will always have a steady supply available to them.
