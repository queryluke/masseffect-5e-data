### Components of a Mechanic
A 'mechanic' is a combination of a rule exception/addition, a potency, and a cost per potency level. Below you'll
find a list of mechanics used in this system.

### Rule exception/addition
The first step is deciding what you want your mechanic to do, e.g. add health, shields, or damage; provide advantage on
saving throws, etc. __We strongly recommend that you do not make new mechanics that increase the combat effectiveness of ranged weapons.
These mechanics should be reserved for weapon mods.__

### Potency
Next, decide how the mechanic's potency will stack. For example, increased shield points have 5 points per potency.
So, an Armor Mod with +10 shield points would have a potency of 2. Armor Mods should never have a potency higher than 3.
Keep this in mind when figuring out the lowest potency amount.

### Cost
Figuring out the cost is mostly guesswork. Low-cost mechanics have minor combat applications, such as additional
carrying capacity or minor speed boosts. These range from 1,000 to 5,000 credits. Mods that increase survivability
(shields, AC, resistances) or damage should range between 5,000 and 20,000 credits
