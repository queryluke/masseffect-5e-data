title: Creating Encounters
---
Though we're eventually planning to create our own encounter creation system, we encourage everyone
to use the great tool created by Kobold Club. Use the
following instructions to import the Mass Effect 5e Bestiary into the site's catalog of monsters.

1. Head over to [Kobold Club](http://kobold.club/fight/#/encounter-builder)
2. In the filters section (upper-left), click on the "Manage Content" button.
3. In the dialog box that appears, enter the following
    - __Name__: Mass Effect 5e
    - __URL or ID__: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-5tAUUiXXMp5K1dRDIgxtgNIH16XLDbrRv65D70U2wg
4. Click the blue "Add" button
       
Now, all of the Mass Effect bestiary mosters are available in Kobold Club's encounter building tool. Thanks to RexThePig 
for creating the Mass Effect 5e Bestiary spreadsheet!
