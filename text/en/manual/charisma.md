title: Charisma
---
Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence,
and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.

### Charisma Checks

A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or
tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance,
and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks (see [Appendix > Skills](/appendix/skills)).

- __*Other Charisma Checks*__. The GM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
  - Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip
  - Blend into a crowd to get a sense of key topics of conversation

### Reputation Ability
Your Paragon and Renegade benefits use Charisma to determine saving throw DCs.

### Powercasting Ability
In Mass Effect 5e, Charisma is not used as a powercasting ability. The debate about which classes should
use Charisma has been constant and never reached consensus. As such, these rules outline using Widsom for Biotic powers
and Intelligence for Tech powers. But we encourage each group and/or GM to use whatever rules they feel best suits their
own interpretation of the Mass Effect games and the mental stats (Widsom, Intelligence, Charisma).

Additionally, anyone who creates new classes for this system can freely use Charisma as a powercasting modifier if
they feel it is a more representative stat for the class's powercasting ability.
