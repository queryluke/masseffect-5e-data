### Mass Effect 5e Bestiary
There is a growing collection of unique Mass Effect monsters in the [Bestiary](/bestiary),
but you might be at a loss when it comes to finding the perfect creature for part of a mission. Feel free to tweak an
existing creature to make it into something more useful for you, perhaps by borrowing a trait or two from a different
monster or by creating your own!

### Using 5th Edition Monsters
You can also include any of the monsters from 5th Edition core rulebooks in any of your campaigns. However, some may require
"re-skinning," meaning you alter the monster's stat block, replacing 5th edition powers with biotics or tech, or
re-conceptualize the animal into some newly-discovered alien.
