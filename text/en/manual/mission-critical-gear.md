title: Mission Critical Gear
---
Mission critical gear (or "gear" for short), is a catch-all category that contains consumables (e.g., medi-gel, thermal clips, and grenades),
but also permanent equipment like heavy weapons and tools.

Notable additions are:

- __Thermal Clips__. A replacement for 5e's ammunition.
- __Heavy Weapons__. Unique and deadly weapons with a unique ammunition type.
- __Heavy Weapon Charges__. Ammunition for more powerful weapons, like missile and grenade launchers.
- __Medi-gel__. A replacement for health potions.
- __Omni-gel__. A crafting material.
- __Grenades & Mines__. These work similarly to spell scrolls, but don't require casters to use them and cannot be "copied".
- __Omni-tool Programs__. These are programs that can be installed on omni-tools and cover many of the edge-case benefits of D&D 5e's wondrous items.

See the [Gear](/gear) list for more information about each of these items.
