title: Monster Types
---
There aren't enough powers and powers to justify making bonuses like "double damage to beast". In addition, many of
the 5th Edition monster types don't make sense in the sci-fi setting (celestials, undead, fey, elemental, etc.). Instead,
there are only three monster types: __Organic__, __Synthetic__, and __Synthorganic__.
