title: Movement
---
Spacewalking along the surface of an asteroid, sneaking down a space station corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain
slope - all sorts of movement play a key role in fantasy gaming adventures.

The GM can summarize the operatives' movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: "You travel through
the dusty desert of Turchanka and find a small outpost late in the evening of the third day." Even in a space station,
particularly a large station or an asteroid colony, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: "After subduing the
guards at the entrance to the underground research facility, you consult your omni-tool, which leads you through
miles of echoing corridors to a large arena with caged varren."

Sometimes it's important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in
days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the
creatures moving and the terrain they're moving over.

### Speed
Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in <me-distance length="0" /> that the character or monster can walk in 1 round.
This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation. The following rules
determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.

::: alert
By default, Mass Effect 5e uses meters instead of feet. You can toggle to imperial measurements at the bottom of the left-hand navigation.

### Travel Pace

While traveling, a group of operatives can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The
table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes
characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.

#### Forced March
The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in a day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.

For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace,
and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours.
On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion.

#### Mounts and Vehicles
For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted
character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are
available every <me-distance length="8" large numOnly /> to <me-distance length="10" large />, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very
rare except in densely populated areas.

Characters in transports choose a pace as normal. The __range__ statistic on transports indicates how far the transport can
travel in a 24 hour period for a _normal_ pace. If you're moving at a fast pace, you can double the range and half it for a
slow pace. Transports do not suffer exhaustion as a living mount would, but characters still need to pilot the vehicle.
In general, characters can only pilot vehicle for 16 hours at a time before needing to rest.

More details about traveling in transports and starships are provided in the [vehicles](/manual/vehicles) section.

|Pace|per Minute|per Hour|per Day|Effect|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Fast|<me-distance length="400" />|<me-distance length="4" large />|<me-distance length="30" large />|-5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores|
|Normal|<me-distance length="300" />|<me-distance length="3" large />|<me-distance length="24" large />|-|
|Slow|<me-distance length="200" />|<me-distance length="2" large />|<me-distance length="18" large />|Able to use stealth|

### Difficult Terrain
The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear corridors.
But operatives can face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled craters, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground -
all considered difficult terrain.

You move at half speed in difficult terrain - moving <me-distance length="1" /> in difficult terrain costs <me-distance length="2" /> of speed - so you can
cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.
