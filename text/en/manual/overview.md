A monster's statistics, sometimes referred to as its __stat block__, provide the essential information that you need to run
the monster. The majority of this section is unchanged from the rules in 5th Edition. You can read the official rules
about monsters in a number of places:

- [SRD](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/PlayerBasicRulesV03.pdf) (p. 254) (downloadable)
