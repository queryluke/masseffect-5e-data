title: Reputation: Paragon & Renegade
---
Reputation in ME5e is the measure of your operative’s _actions_, whereas alignment in ME5e is the
representation of your character’s _ideals_ or _moral attitudes_ (your character wants to be good or evil,
but there may be outstanding circumstances or exceptions). In ME5e, the reputation of your
operative’s actions is measured in "Paragon" and "Renegade", but these are not synonymous
with “good” and “evil.” The culmination of actions can rarely be judged as
empirically “good” or “evil.” Therefore “Paragon” and “Renegade” represent
characteristics of your action’s motivation and/or outcomes rather than any subjective “goodness” or “evilness.”

__Paragon__ actions are open-ended (allowing for future possibilities), utilitarian (benefits the most people),
logical, and tend to use persuasion over intimidation or brute force.

__Renegade__ actions are decisive and final, emotional, gain immediate results, and often use a show of force.

While paragon actions _tend_ to be lawful and/or good, and renegade actions _tend_ to be evil and/or chaotic, this
is not an absolute. See __A Complex Renegade and Paragon Example__ below.

Paragon and renegade are not a single sliding scale. A paragon action will not make up for a renegade one;
therefore, a low paragon reputation will not stop people from fearing a killer or remove the reputation
of an unsympathetic heel. Nor will the occasional brutal action significantly damage the reputation of an
otherwise upstanding soldier.

### Earning Reputation

Like inspiration, gaining reputation is a reward for roleplaying your character and is entirely at the GMs discretion.
Your GM can choose to reward paragon or renegade reputation for a variety of reasons, but typically it is
rewarded based on an action you take or an action your party makes. You can gain any amount
of paragon and/or renegade simultaneously. Additionally, reputation can be rewarded
to the entire party, individually, or both. See __A Complex Renegade and Paragon Example__ below for a detailed example.

Your GM can award any amount of paragon or renegade reputation for your actions, but you can never have more than
a score of 100 in either reputation. For example’s sake, a character with a 100 reputation score in either would have
galactic-wide notoriety. So your GM can certainly allow totals more than 100, but there are no additional
benefits for exceeding 100. For GMs, see the __Total Reputation per Tier__ table to assist with how often and
how much reputation you should reward. Note that total reputation equals the summation of a player’s paragon and
renegade scores.

#### A Complex Renegade and Paragon Example
In Mass Effect 2, you are faced with the decision to save the genophage data (which might result in curing the genophage)
or destroying it.

Assume a player party of a neutral human, a lawful good salarian, and a chaotic evil krogan. The salarian thinks curing
the genophage could result in the destruction of the galaxy; thus, the most logical and utilitarian decision would be to
destroy it; he even threatens his own party at gunpoint. The krogan speaks emotionally about her difficult upbringing
and the countless children she’s lost, and wants to save the data. The human listens intently and ultimately
sides with one or the other.

In this scenario, the outcome (saving or destroying the data) will represent the largest distribution of paragon or
renegade points. Saving the data presents future possibilities (paragon) whereas destroying it is final (renegade).
Thus, the GM may award 10 paragon or renegade points to the entire party. However, the GM can also award points
based on the individual character's actions:
- 2 renegade points to the salarian. Their actions may have appeared logical, but their emotional fear of krogan
destruction and threatening their own party was extremely “renegade-esque”
- 1 paragon point and 1 renegade point to the krogan, their actions were emotional but they used their words rather
than drawing their weapon and trying to intimidate the salarian
- 2 paragon points to the human for remaining calm and emotionless and listening to all sides

The most important aspect of this new Reputation system is to give players more freedom with their actions
outside of their chosen alignment. Thus, it is a reward for good role-playing rather than a
resource one is meant to “grind.”

### Benefits of Reputation

Whenever you gain reputation, you can choose one benefit from the list below. Each benefit lists a __threshold__ and a
__prerequisite__. To gain that benefit, your total reputation score must meet or exceed the threshold, and your
individual scores (paragon or renegade) must meet the listed prerequisite. You gain benefits at certain thresholds
- 15, 30, 60, and 100 - but you can only gain one benefit per threshold.

In most cases, a prerequisite indicates a comparison of your renegade and paragon scores. For example,
all paragon-based benefits require your paragon score to be greater than your renegade score, and vice versa.
However, there are benefits that require your paragon and renegade scores to be relatively close to one another.
For example, __Prerequisite: Renegade = Paragon ± 5__, indicates your renegade score must be equal to your paragon
score plus or minus 5. Thus, if you had a renegade score of 10, you could have a paragon score between 5 and 15.

#### Losing and Changing Benefits
If gaining paragon or renegade causes you to no longer meet a benefit’s requirements, you lose that benefit
when you take a long rest, representing the time it takes for your reputation to spread throughout social circles.
During this long rest, you can replace the lost benefit with a new benefit as long as you meet the new benefit’s
prerequisites and only select one benefit per threshold.

#### Reputation Ability
Your reputation is further advanced by your Charisma and you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw
DC of a reputation benefit. The DC = __8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier__.
