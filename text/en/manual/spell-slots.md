title: Power Slots
---
Regardless of how many biotic powers knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of powers before resting.
Manipulating the gravitational forces into even a simple power is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level powers
are even more so. Thus, each biotic class's description includes a table showing how many power slots of each power level
a character can use at each character level.

When a character casts a power, he or she expends a slot of that power's level or higher, effectively "filling" a slot
with the power. You can think of a power slot as a groove of a certain size - small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a
power of higher level. A 1st-level power fits into a slot of any size, but a 4th-level power fits only in a 4th-level slot.
So when an adept casts lance, a 1st-level power, he or she spends one 1st-level slot.

Finishing a long rest restores any expended power slots.

### Casting at a Higher Level
When a powercaster casts a power using a slot that is of a higher level than the power, the power assumes the higher level
for that casting. For instance, if an operative casts lance using one of their 2nd-level slots, that lance is 2nd level.

Effectively, the power expands to fill the slot it is put into.

Some powers, such as lance and first aid, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a
power's description.

### Tech Points <v-chip color="info" small>new</v-chip>
In Mass Effect 5e, certain classes can use tech points to cast powers. Tech points represent the internal power of
the operative's omni-tool. As the operative levels, the gain more tech points, representing the time they spend
modifying their omni-tool and optimizing subroutines.

When a character casts a power with tech points, he or she expends, at minimum, one tech point per power's level:
1 tech point for 1st-level, 2 tech points for 2nd level, etc. You can think of a tech point as a 1st-level power slot that
can be added to other tech points to create a power slot of a higher level. The number of tech points you can spend
on a power is limited by your class's level, indicated in the class's progression table.

Finishing a long rest restores any expended tech points.
