title: The Environment
---
Going on missions can involve delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of environmental hazards. The rules
in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places.

### Falling
A fall from a great height is a common hazard, especially since many urban environments reach the skies. At the end of a
fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every <me-distance length="10" /> it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature
lands prone unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.

### Suffocating
A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).

When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier
(minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can't regain hit
points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.

For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2
rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.

### Space <v-chip color="info" small>new</v-chip>
The vacuum of space will kill any organic (and most synth-organic creatures) in a matter of minutes unless that creature
has some specific environmental suit or resilience to surviving in a vacuum. A creature in the vacuum of space
will __remain conscious__ for a number of rounds equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum 1), after which it becomes
incapacitated.

In addition, a creature in the vacuum of space can survive a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution
modifier (minimum 1), after which it dies.

For example, a creature with a Constitution of 16, will become incapacitated after 3 rounds (~18 seconds).
But it can survive in the vacuum for 3 minutes. The creature may also suffer additional effects, such as damage, while in
a vacuum at the GM's discretion.
