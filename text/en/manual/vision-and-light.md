title: Vision and Light
---
The most fundamental tasks of a mission - noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and
targeting a biotic power, to name just a few - rely heavily on a character's ability to see. Darkness and other effects
that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.

### Obscured
A given area might be __lightly__ or __heavily obscured__.

In a __lightly obscured__ area, such as dim light, patchy fog,
or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

A __heavily obscured__ area - such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage - blocks vision entirely. A creature
effectively suffers from the blinded condition when trying to see something in that area.

### Light
The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: __bright light__, __dim light__,
and __darkness__.

__Bright light__ lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do flashlights, fires, and
other sources of illumination within a specific radius.

__Dim light__, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between
a source of bright light, such as a flashlight, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts
as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon (or moons) might bathe the surface of a planet in dim light.

__Darkness__ creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night, within the confines of a derelict
starship, or a subterranean ruin.

### Blindsight
A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures
without eyes, such as thresher maws, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and yaghs, have
this sense.

### Darkvision
Some creatures have darkvision and some gear can provide darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision
can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that
creature is concerned. However, the creature can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Truesight <v-chip color="warning" text-color="black" small>change</v-chip>
A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal darkness, see invisible creatures and objects that
are hidden by technological means (such as tactical cloak).

### Infrared vision <v-chip color="info" small>new</v-chip>
A creature with infrared vision, out to a specific range, can see in darkness, is unaffected by lightly or heavily obscured
areas, and see invisible and hidden creatures and objects that give off heat.

However, the creature cannot see beyond intense heat sources and is effectively blind when looking at an intense heat source.
