name: Elite Heavy Shoulder Mounts
flavor: >-
  Originally designed for Elcor battlesuits, these hydraulic
  mounts allow you to equip and fire ranged weapons from your shoulder.
---
You must spend 10 minutes during a short rest to equip and calibrate up to two ranged weapons.
This is considered light activity.

While you have one or more ranged weapons equipped in these mounts, you may make ranged attack
rolls with the weapons as normal, but you use your Intelligence modifier for the attack and damage
rolls. Additionally, the weapons cannot be dropped or removed against your will and do not take
up any of your armorâ€™s weapon slots.

Reloading mounted weapons is no different than a weapon you are wielding.

Your armor can only have one __shoulder mounts__ mod installed at once.
