Choose a target location within <me-distance length="75" />. Creatures within a 
<me-distance length="10" /> of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature 
takes 3d12 force damage, or have as much damage on a successful one. You must finish a short rest, 
allowing the weapon to recharge before using it again.
