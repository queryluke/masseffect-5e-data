The weapon loses the Burst Fire property. Its damage type becomes thunder. On a hit, the target takes an 
additional 3d6 thunder damage and becomes prone. On a miss, the grenade lands <me-distance length="10" /> beyond the 
target. At the end of your turn, each creature within <me-distance length="5" /> of the grenade must succeed on a 
DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 thunder damage.
