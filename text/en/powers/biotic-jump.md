Your Powercasting Ability determines how far you can jump.

__Long Jump__. When you make a long jump, you cover a number of <me-distance length="0" /> up to your Powercasting Ability score. If jumping
over an obstacle, subtract <me-distance length="5" /> of distance per <me-distance length="10" /> of the obstacle's height.

__High Jump__. When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of <me-distance length="0" /> equal to <me-distance length="5" numOnly /> + your Powercasting Modifier.
