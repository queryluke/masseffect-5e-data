Summon 3 biotic orbs that float around you, fueling your biotic energies. As an action, you may expend an orb and make a
ranged power attack on a creature within <me-distance length="90" />. On a hit, deal force damage equal to 2d10 + your powercasting ability modifier.

As an action, you may expend 3 orbs to cast a power using your highest available power slot. Casting a power in this way
