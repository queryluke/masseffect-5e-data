Choose one object weighing <me-weight amount="2"/> to <me-weight amount="20"/> within range that isn't being worn or carried. The object
flies in a straight line up to <me-distance length="90" /> in a direction you choose before falling to the ground, stopping early if it impacts
against a solid surface. If the object would strike a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a
failed save, the object strikes the creature and stops moving. When the object strikes something, the object and what it
strikes each take 3d10 bludgeoning damage.

__At Higher Levels__: When you cast this power using a power slot of 2nd level or higher, the maximum weight of objects
that you can target with this power increases by <me-weight amount="10"/>, and the damage increases by 2d10, for each slot level
above 1st.
