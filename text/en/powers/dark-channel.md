Make a ranged power attack on a creature you can see within range. On a hit, you plague the target with a persistent,
damaging biotic field. The creature is <me-condition id="primed" sub="necrotic"/> and takes 1d6 necrotic damage and 1d6
necrotic damage at the start of your turn while you maintain the power. If the creature dies, dark channel transfers to
the nearest hostile creature within <me-distance length="30" /> of the target.

The damage increases by 1d6 when you reach the 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6) and 17th level (4d6).
