Rapidly altering the mass of air particles creates radioactive projectiles that seek out the targets and explode. Choose
up to 4 creatures that you can see within range. Each creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
a creature is <me-condition id="blinded"/> until the end of your next turn and takes radiant damage equal to 6d12. On a
successful save, a creature takes half damage but suffers no other negative effect.

__At Higher Levels__: When you cast this power using a power slot of 5th level, increase the damage by 2d12.
