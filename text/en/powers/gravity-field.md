You create a field of unstable gravity in a <me-distance length="15" adj/> cube starting from a point within range.  For the duration, this
space becomes difficult terrain.

A creature in the area when you cast the power must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be <me-condition id="restrained"/>
until the power ends. A creature restrained by this power can use its action to make a Strength check against your
power save DC. On a success, it frees itself.

When the power ends, the gravity field dissipates.
