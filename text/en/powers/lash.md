Make a ranged power attack on a target you can see within range. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage and becomes
<me-condition id="grappled"/>. While grappled the creature is <me-condition id="primed" sub="force"/>. To escape the grapple,
the creature must succeed on a contested Strength (Athletics) check against your Constitution. This power also ends if
the creature is hit with a detonating attack or if you move more than <me-distance length="60" /> away from the target.

__At Higher Levels__: When you cast this power using a power slot of 3rd or higher, the damage increases by 2d8 for each
slot level above the 2nd.
