Transfer the energy of your barrier into a biotic explosion, consuming your remaining barrier ticks. Creatures within a
<me-distance length="5" adj/> sphere centered on you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is knocked prone and takes
force damage equal to Xd8, where X is the number of barrier ticks. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much
damage.

This power's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (X + 1d8), 11th level (X + 2d8), 17th level (X + 3d8)
