Unleash an electrostatic discharge at a creature or object within range. Three bolts then leap from that target to as
many as three other targets, each of which must be within <me-distance length="15" /> of the first target. A target can be a creature or an
object and can be targeted by only one of the bolts.

A target becomes <me-condition id="primed" sub="lightning"/> until the start of your next turn and must make a Dexterity
saving throw. The target takes 3d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

__At Higher Levels__: When you cast this power using a power slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases
by 2d6 for each slot level above 1st.
