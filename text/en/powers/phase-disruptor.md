You focus the energy of your barrier into a high-powered beam at a target creature or object within range. Remove 1
barrier tick and make a ranged power attack on that target. On a hit, the creature takes 3d4 force damage.

You may use additional barrier ticks to create more than one beam at higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams
at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones.
Make a separate attack roll for each beam.
