Make a ranged power attack on a Medium or smaller creature or object within range. On a success, you create a mass
effect field around the target and it becomes <me-condition id="lifted"/> <me-distance length="5" /> in the air until the end of your next turn.
While you maintain this power, as a bonus action, you can move the target up to <me-distance length="10" /> in any direction. If you move the
target further than <me-distance length="90" /> away from you, the power ends and the target falls to the ground.

__At Higher Levels__: When you cast this power using a power slot of 2nd level or higher, increase the duration.
1 minute at 2nd level, 10 minutes at 3rd level, and 1 hour at 4th level.
