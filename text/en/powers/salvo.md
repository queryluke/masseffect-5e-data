    text: When you cast salvo, you may create phosphorous darts instead. The darts no longer deal damage and cannot detonate primed targets. Instead, each dart explodes in a bright flash of light. Each creature hit by a dart must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or becomes blinded until the end of your next turn.

creature or several.
