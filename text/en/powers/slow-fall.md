When you or a creature within <me-distance length="30" /> of you falls, choose up to five falling creatures within range. Create a negative mass
effect field around each creature, slowing the rate of descent to <me-distance length="60" /> per round. If the creature lands before the power
ends, it takes no Falling damage and can land on its feet, and the power ends for that creature.
