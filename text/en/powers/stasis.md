Lock a target in a high-gravity mass effect field. Choose a creature you can see within range. The creature must make a
Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is <me-condition id="paralyzed" />, <me-condition id="primed" sub="force" />, and has resistance to all damage for
the duration of the power. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Strength saving throw. On a success,
the power ends. A detonating attack immediately ends the power.
