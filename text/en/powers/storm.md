    text: Until the power ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to cause a bolt of necrotic energy to leap from the center of the sphere toward one creature you choose within <me-distance length="60" /> of the center. Make a ranged power attack. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is in the sphere. On a hit, the target takes 4d10 necrotic damage. Necrotic bolts can detonate primed targets.

    text: While the power is maintained, the storm's radius grows by <me-distance length="5" /> at the start of your turn.

An <me-distance length="20" adj />-radius sphere of rapid shifting mass effect fields springs into existence centered on a point you choose within
range, creating a dangerous whirlwind of debris and energy. The sphere remains for the power’s duration. Each creature
in the sphere when it appears or that ends its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a
creature takes 8d10 force damage or half as much on a successful one. The sphere’s space is difficult terrain.

__At Higher Levels__: When you cast this power using a power slot of 5th level, the damage increases for each of its effects by 2d10.
