Spend your action scanning a creature you can see, studying its movement and revealing weaknesses.
Make a Wisdom (Insight) check, contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. On a success, you have advantage on
attack rolls against the target and you score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

This benefit lasts 1 minute or until you successfully use this feature against a different target.
