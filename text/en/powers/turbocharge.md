Activate a subroutine that temporarily vents weapon heat through your armor to improve thermal clip efficiency and
weapon damage. Until the end of your turn, a ranged weapon you're holding gains Burst Fire, the heat cost for making
a Burst Fire attack is reduced by 1 heat, and you may make a Burst Fire attack as an Attack action.

You must finish a short or long rest before using Turbocharge again.
