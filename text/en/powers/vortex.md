You intertwine negative and positive mass effect fields to create a swirling vortex. Creatures within a <me-distance length="30" adj/> cone must
make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save a creature takes 6d10 force damage, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Creatures that fail the saving throw are thrown 1d6 + <me-distance length='5' /> away from you and become prone.

__At Higher Levels__: When you cast this power using a power slot of 4th level or higher, increase the damage by 2d10 for
each slot level above the 3rd.
