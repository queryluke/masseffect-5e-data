title: Feats
---
A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies
training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. Mass Effect 5e uses a number of feats in the
Player's Manual, providing page numbers for reference.

At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you
can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless
the feat’s description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite,
you can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite.
