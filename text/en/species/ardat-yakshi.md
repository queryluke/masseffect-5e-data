  Ardat-yakshi often develop psychopathy. Ardat-yakshi are normally evil, but can also be neutral.
---
A rare genetic condition in asari that affects about 1% of the population and is more common in "purebloods"
(2 asari parents). The condition is impossible to identify until the asari reaches maturity, by which time it is too
late to correct. When diagnosed, the ardat-yakshi is given a choice to live in isolation or to be executed.
This is because ardat-yakshi develop an addiction to the power and feel intense compulsion to meld. The addiction only
grows stronger with each meld, and so a life of monastic celibacy allows asari to live in peace with a controllable desire.
Those who are able to avoid isolation and execution, however, quickly become psychopathic in their intense lust for the
destructive melding.

If you would like to play an ardat-yakshi, gain the Addiction trait and replace Life Stage with Disposition or the
