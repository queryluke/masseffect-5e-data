- You may use your bonus action to target a creature within <me-distance length="60" />. Each other creature
that makes an attack roll against the target for the first time, gains Avatar’s Inspiration. Once you
use this ability, you can’t use it again until you roll initiative at the start of combat or until you
finish a short or long rest.
- Creatures can apply their Avatar’s Inspiration die gained from you to damage rolls.
