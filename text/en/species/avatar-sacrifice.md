When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within <me-distance length="5" /> of you with an attack,
you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus
(to a minimum of 0 damage). You suffer the reduced damage instead and the target gains Avatarâ€™s Inspiration.
