- You do not need to sleep. Instead, you can meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious,
for 4 hours a day. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
- Whenever you take a short or long rest, you can grant Avatar’s Inspiration to a number of creatures,
other than yourself, equal to your proficiency bonus. The creatures must be able to see and hear you.
The inspiration lasts 1 hour instead of 10 minutes.
- Creatures can apply their Avatar’s Inspiration die gained from you to death saving throws.
