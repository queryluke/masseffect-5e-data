When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you
advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have
advantage until your next turn. The first time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack roll using
Strength this turn, you can use your reaction to give Avatarâ€™s Inspiration to one creature, other than you,
within <me-distance length="30" /> that can see you.
