The Collectors are an enigmatic species that live beyond the Omega 4 Relay, a mass relay within the same system as
Omega, in the Terminus Systems. They are rarely seen in the Terminus itself, let alone Citadel space, and are
generally regarded as a myth by Citadel citizens. Definite sightings of Collectors have been made on Omega every few centuries.

### Genetic Modification
Collectors are former Protheans that have been completely subjugated by their Reaper masters. Their DNA shows signs of
"extensive genetic rewrite" including three fewer chromosomes, reduced heterochromatin structure, and the elimination
of superfluous "junk" sequences.

### The Awakening
When the Reaper-killer known as Leviathan fought the Collectors, it severed their connection to Harbinger with a
thrall device. Most Collector forces died as a result, but a few survived. Now, these rare individuals fight for the
memory of their people, a proud species broken by the Reapers.

### Collector Names
Collector communication mostly consists of insectoid chirps and trills and little is known about the meaning of their names (if any).
