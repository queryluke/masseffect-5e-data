name: Matriarch

The Matriarch stage begins around 700 years of age, or earlier if the individual melds rarely. Matriarchs become
active in their community as sages and councilors, dispensing wisdom from centuries of experience. Their knowledge
and guidance may be one reason why Matriarchs are rarely seen outside asari space.
