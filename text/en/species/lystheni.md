name: Lystheni

The Lystheni are an "offshoot" of the salarians, unwelcome in Council space. They may be found living among batarians,
exiled quarians, and other galactic refuse at the Omega station. Little is known about Lystheni other than they are
considerably stronger, durable, and live longer lives. There are rumors on the extranet that their genes have
been spliced with Krogan DNA, though there is no evidence to support the claim.

If you choose to play a Lystheni, replace the Ability Score Increase, High-Speed Metabolism, and Twice as Bright
with the following.
