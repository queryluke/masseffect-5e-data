snippet: >-
  The volus hail from Irune, which possesses a high-pressure greenhouse
  atmosphere able to support an ammonia-based biochemistry. As a result, the
  volus must wear pressure suits and breathers when dealing with other species.

The volus are an associate species on the Citadel with their own embassy but are also a client species of the turians. They
hail from Irune, which possesses a high-pressure greenhouse atmosphere able to support ammonia-based biochemistry.

### Mysterious Biology
The volus are unable to survive unprotected in an atmosphere more suitable to humans and other carbon-based lifeforms,
and as such require pressurized, protective suits capable of providing the proper atmosphere. Traditional nitrogen/oxygen
air mixtures are poisonous to them, and in the low pressure atmospheres tolerable to most species, their flesh will actually
split open.Unlike quarians, who can withstand brief periods outside their suit, volus choose never to take theirs off,
especially in the presence of other species. Therefore, little is known about their physiology. Despite individuals distinctly
sounding like males or females to human listeners, volus genders are a mystery as well. The volus themselves consider
the question both intrusive and hilariously irrelevant.

### Trade Warriors
The volus homeworld Irune is remarkable for having done away with warfare as an institution of the state. Instead,
volus romanticize a good bargain, haggling, and creative accounting. The fervent pursuit of economic wealth has
made volus a species of aggressive traders and industrialists with a keen grasp of exchange and finance.
Many of the galaxy's largest banks, holding corporations, and manufacturing cartels, such as the
Elkoss Combine, are owned or managed by volus. They also regulate the Citadel's complex galactic economy and were
responsible for the Unified Banking Act, which established the "credit" as the standard currency of interstellar
trade.

Unlike most other species, volus are more comfortable with delayed gratification, especially when it comes to spending
their credits. Fugacious and materialistic purchases are rarely made. Instead, volus like to invest or save their money,
sometimes to a fault. In fact, the volus economy is largely bolstered by the large estates of wealthy volus who never
spent a cred.

### Council Seat
Despite their important contributions to the Citadel and galactic society, they have never been offered a seat on the
Council. This is a source of anger for some volus, particularly the volus ambassador Din Korlack. Council species need
to have provided some extraordinary service to the Citadel, such as the turians' military support during the
Krogan Rebellions. Council species also need to provide fleets, resources, and economic aid in case of disaster,
none of which the volus can currently supply. Therefore, the latest investment pursued by the volus is the construction
of well-armed dreadnoughts.

### Volus Names
Volus have two names but no family names. According to volus sensibilities, one cannot own a person, so using a family
name would essentially be laying claim to their offspring.
