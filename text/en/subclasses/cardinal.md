Somewhere in the Attican Traverse, lies the hidden human majority colony of Crimsonbank. This colony invites those
that want a life away from the Citadel and all, and a life of nothing but independence, fortune and glory with
challenging environmental conditions and dangerous wildlife.

In the tropical swamps towards the equator, the "Exalted Prophets" took residence within the swamps and became obsessed
with the biotic beasts within, to the point of near worship, wanting the gifts of their power for themselves. Consuming
these beasts for the majority of their lives have given them unique biotic traits, to the point of being able to summon
weapons using their own biotic amps, their own ferocity making them stronger.
