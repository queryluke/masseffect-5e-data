After the Morning War, the Geth were feared as the monsters in the darkness to Quarian children. One Quarian, during
his pilgrimage was exposed to a video game called Galaxy of Fantasy, and was inspired to become the hero that defended
the helpless against the Geth and beyond. He tinkered with his omni-tool for years to try and make his bladed weapons
better than anything ever seen before, but two things were holding him back from realising the true potential of his
vision; Power Optimisation and Stabilty.

It was impossible for a creature of flesh and bone to be able to master the fast corrections needed to stop his Omni-tool
from overloading from extensive use, and a VI didn't seem to be enough for the task. In order to fix this problem, he
had to turn to the most forbidden practices among his people; designing a new Artificial Intelligence for his armor and
omni-tool.

"While you were looking for gifts on your pilgrimage, I was studying the convergence of the blade and the Omni-tool."

You can work with your GM to give your AI a personality if you wish, but given the amount of processing power required
to optimise and stabilise your Omni-tool, it won't be any real assistance to tasks outside of combat, it'll just be an
AI that can perform VI-level tasks or to simply talk to.
