name: Legionnaire

The Legionnaires, known to few outside of the colony as the "Legion of Judgement" became the police force that
maintained order within the remains of the original colony after the main conflict ended. They rule with a fair but
iron fist, organising hunts to find food for the colony at a regular interval, while the rest patrol the streets
to keep the peace. Legionnaires would only leave if they got tired of the colony policing life, searching the
stars for more glory and honour.
