Somewhere in the Attican Traverse, lies the hidden human majority colony of Crimsonbank. This colony invites those
that want a life away from the Citadel and all, and a life of nothing but independence, fortune and glory with
challenging environmental conditions and dangerous wildlife.

The Legionnaires, known to few outside of the colony as the "Legion of Judgement" became the police force
that maintained order within the colony. They rule with a fair but iron fist, organising hunts to find food
for the colony at a regular interval, while the rest patrol the streets to keep the peace. Legionnaires would only
leave if they got tired of the colony policing life, searching the stars for an even more glorious purpose.
