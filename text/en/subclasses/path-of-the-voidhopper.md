name: Path of the Voidhopper

You took the path of least resistance: the one which doesn't exist. As a Voidhopper, you focus your biotic prowess
into the difficult yet awesome power of Blinking, rushing in between adversaries and leaving them confused as to your
whereabouts.

__Addendum__: Whenever a feature of the Voidhopper states you need to move half your speed, it also means you
cannot end your movement in the same square that you started in.
