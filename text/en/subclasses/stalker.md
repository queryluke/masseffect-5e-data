The last of the three factions that took residence within the most dangerous forests of Chasca - the "Night Stalkers" -
looked to the location that had the most food and water within a short distance to sustain themselves for

improve their hunting methods, using equipment and stealth to their advantage, up to the point of being able to attack
and still remain hidden to strike again from the shadows.
