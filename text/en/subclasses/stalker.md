Somewhere in the Attican Traverse, lies the hidden human majority colony of Crimsonbank. This colony invites those
that want a life away from the Citadel and all, and a life of nothing but independence, fortune and glory with
challenging environmental conditions and dangerous wildlife.

The "Night Stalkers" resided in the dense forests and jungles that had the most food and water within a short
distance to sustain themselves for potentially many generations. The increased challenge of the creatures of this
region have given them the incentive to improve their hunting methods for survival, using equipment and stealth to
their advantage, up to the point of being able to attack and still remain hidden to strike again from the shadows.
