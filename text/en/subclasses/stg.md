Disruption and preemptive strikes are the hallmarks of the Special Tasks Group. Using cunning and technology, you
seek to capitalize on every advantage you can get, and strike before your enemies even know what hit them.

__Restricted to Salarian__: This subclass is canonically only available to Salarian characters. Consult with your GM about waiving this restriction.
