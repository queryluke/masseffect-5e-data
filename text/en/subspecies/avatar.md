The Protheans designated certain people as avatars, or exemplars, of particular virtues: bravery, strength, cunning,
etc. You may pick an Avatar below or create your own using the Creating an Avatar section. Whichever avatar you
choose, you gain the Avatar’s Inspiration trait as well.

#### Creating an Avatar

Instead of selecting an Avatar, you may choose to create your own, working with your GM and following these guidelines:

1. The avatar should have some mechanic for triggering Avatar’s Inspiration
2. If the triggering mechanic is likely to only be used once per long rest or less:
  - Avatar’s Inspiration should apply to multiple creatures simultaneously (if thematically appropriate)
  - +1 to a thematically appropriate ability score
  - One additional “minor” trait, such as a skill or tool proficiency, advantage on an uncommon saving throw, etc
3. If the triggering mechanic is likely to be used once per short rest:
  - Avatar’s Inspiration should apply to one creature
  - One additional “minor” trait, such as a skill or tool proficiency, advantage on an uncommon saving throw, etc
4. If the triggering mechanic is likely to be used multiple times per short rest:
  - Avatar’s Inspiration should apply to one creature
  - No other benefits
