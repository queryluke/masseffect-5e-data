name: Addiction
---
All ardat-yakshi feel the urge to mate. Some choose to live in isolation to help reduce this urge, but it never truly abates.

Addiction is measured in five levels. Once per day, you must make a DC 0 Constitution saving throw. Every day you do
not mate, the DC of this saving throw increases by 5. On a failed save, your addiction level increases by 1.

You suffer the effect of your current addiction level as well as all lower levels. Mating with a creature removes
all levels of addiction and resets the DC of your addiction saving throw to 0.

##### Addiction Levels

Level|Effect
---|---
1|Disadvantage on initiative rolls
2|Disadvantage on attack rolls
3|Disadvantage on ability checks
4|Disadvantage on saving throws
5|You can no longer distinguish friend from foe. Every creature is considered a hostile creature

#### Ardat-Yakshi mating

Whether or not your Ardat-Yakshi can successfully mate is at your GMs discretion. A basic rule is that you must
have a viable mate (an organic creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher) and you must pass a
Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Performance) check contested by the creature’s Wisdom (Insight).

Additionally, whether or not the target survives the mating is at the GMs discretion. GMs may have the mated
target roll a Constitution saving throw, apply a flat “unconscious for 1d4 hours”, suffer 1 level of exhaustion,
any combination, or adjudicate their own result.
