name: Aspiration

You aspire to become an Avatar one day, but have not quite achieved the mantle. Whenever you make an attack roll,
skill check, or saving throw you may roll a d4 and add it to the roll. You can wait until after you roll the
d20 before deciding to use the d4, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short rest or long rest.
