name: Avatar's Inspiration
---
You can inspire others by being an exemplar of your selected virtue, allowing creature’s to gain an Avatar’s
Inspiration die; a d4.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check,
attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use
the Avatar’s Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the
Avatar’s Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Avatar’s Inspiration die at a time.

Your chosen avatar identifies the conditions that allow granting Avatar’s Inspiration.
