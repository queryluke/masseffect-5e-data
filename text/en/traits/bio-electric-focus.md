You can cast a 1st-level version of shocking grasp without expending a power slot or tech point. Charisma is your
powercasting modifier for this ability. This does not count against your max number of cantrips known or powers prepared.

If you wish to cast an advanced version of shocking grasp or cast it at a higher level, you must prepare it and/or
expend power slots/tech points as normal.
