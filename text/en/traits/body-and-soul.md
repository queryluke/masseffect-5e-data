If you spend 10 minutes in prayer, you can mental focus your body and soul into a true Whole. The next time you are
reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you gain advantage on all death saving throws until you are
stabilized or regain hit points, at which point you cannot benefit from this feature again until you finish a long rest.
