When you are hit by a melee weapon attack by a creature you can see, you may use your reaction to release a powerful
bioelectrical charge. The attacking creature suffers 2d4 lightning damage and cannot take reactions until the end of its next turn.

Alternatively, you may use your Action to touch one creature and end the stunned condition or stabilize it.

You may use this feature between long rests equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1).
