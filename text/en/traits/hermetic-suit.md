---
name: Hermetic Suit
---
You have a weak immune system and dress, by necessity, in a highly sophisticated, skin-tight
enviro-suit to protect you from disease or infection.

While you are within your suit, you are immune to disease and you have resistance to poison and necrotic damage.

However, you are always at risk. If you are the victim of a critical hit that deals piercing or slashing damage,
your suit becomes breached. For each hour in which you have a breach in your suit, you suffer one level of
exhaustion. For each hour you spend outside of your suit if not in a compatible environment,
suffer 3 levels of exhaustion.

As an action, you may spend 1 omni-gel to seal your suit. You have 3 omni-gel as part of your starting equipment.
