Your optic sensors have built-in enhancements. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can toggle your
infrared vision on or off. While on, your sight becomes a gradient map of the heat produced by your surroundings (hotter
objects appear brighter and cooler objects appear darker; you cannot discern color). Your can see in darkness
and your sight is unaffected by lightly and heavily obscured areas within <me-distance length="60" />. You can also
see hidden and invisible creatures within <me-distance length="60" /> as long as a creature's body is a
few degrees cooler or warmer than its surroundings.
