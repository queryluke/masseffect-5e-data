name: Innate Biotics

Choose a class: Adept or Vanguard. You learn two biotic cantrips of your choice from that classâ€™s power list.
In addition, choose one 1st-level power from that same list. You learn that power and can cast it at its
lowest level. Once you cast it, you must finish a long rest before you can cast it again. Wisdom is your
powercasting modifier for these powers.

Neither of the cantrips nor the power can be an advanced version. But you can learn or prepare an
advanced version of the power as your class permits.
