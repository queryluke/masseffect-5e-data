Your body has built-in defensive layers, which can be enhanced with armor:

- You can equip only armor with which you have proficiency. To equip armor other than a shield,
  you must incorporate it into your body over the course of 1 hour, during which you remain in
  contact with the armor. To unequip armor, you must spend 1 hour removing it.
- You can rest while equipping or unequipping armor in this way.

While you inhabit this mobile platform, the armor incorporated into your body canâ€™t be removed against your will.
