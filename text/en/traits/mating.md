name: Mating
---
Each time an Ardat-Yakshi mates it becomes stronger, smarter, and deadlier. The Mating table below shows how many
different additional mates the Ardat-Yakshi needs to feed upon (after 1st level) in order to obtain their
newfound strengths.

Each time you reach the required number of mates, you may either gain +1 to an ability score of your
choice or gain proficiency in a skill or tool of your choice. You may also gain expertise if you are already
proficient in the skill.
