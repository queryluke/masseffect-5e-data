name: Mind Break
---
You can touch a willing creature and initiate a mind meld. If the target is unwilling, the meld does not continue. 
The creature must make a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be 
rendered unconscious for 1d4 hours as your nervous system overwhelms theirs. Once you use this trait, you can't 
use it again until you finish a long rest.
