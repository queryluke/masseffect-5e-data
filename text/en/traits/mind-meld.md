name: Mind Meld
---
As an action, you can attempt to transfer or receive thoughts from another organic creature within
<me-distance length="5" />. If the creature is unwilling, it must make a Wisdom saving throw equal to
8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier. If it fails, you can successfully begin the meld,
initially learning the surface thoughts of the creature -- what is most on its mind in that moment.
If you choose a creature that has an Intelligence of 3 or lower, the creature is unaffected.

If you have an active mind meld, you can attempt to probe deeper into the creature's mind as an Action.
If you do, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms
large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). Alternatively, you may use
your action to direct questions at the target creature to naturally shape the course of its thoughts.

Mind meld lasts 1 minute. An unwilling creature makes another Wisdom saving throw at the start of
each of its turns. On a successful save, the meld ends. Mind meld also ends if you attempt to mind
meld another creature or the creature is farther than <me-distance length="5" /> from you. You may also end the meld
as a free action on your turn.

You may use Mind Meld a number of times between long rests equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).
