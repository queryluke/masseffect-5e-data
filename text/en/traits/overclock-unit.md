name: Overclock Unit

You can activate your muscular augments for a burst of speed. When you move on your turn in
combat, you can double your speed until the end of the tum. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you
recharge the unit by moving <me-distance length="0" override="0 {metric}"/> on one of your turns.
