name: Psychometry
---
While in physical contact with a creature or object, you can recall its experiences. If you touch an object or
creature and concentrate on it for 1 minute, you learn a few basic facts about it. You gain a mental image from the object
or creature's point of view, learning of any events that have occurred within <me-distance length="30" />  of the
object or creature within the past 24 hours. If in contact with an object, you see the last creature to
hold the object, regardless of how long ago it was last handled.

You may use your psychometry once per long rest.
