In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your size and weight.
When you make such a climb, each <me-distance length="1" /> of movement costs you
<me-distance length="4" override="extra {metric}"/>, instead of the normal <me-distance length="1" override="extra {metric}"/>.

Finally, a Medium or smaller creature can ride on your back if you allow it. In such a situation, you continue
