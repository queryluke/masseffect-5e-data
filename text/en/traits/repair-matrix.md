As a construct, you cannot be healed by medi-gel or powers that heal organic creatures (such as the _first aid_ power).

Instead, you can use your Action to expend a Hit Die. Roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You regain
hit points equal to the total. You also regain all spent hit dice at the end of a long rest, instead of the usual amount.

You gain additional hit dice based on your level. At the 4th level, you gain one d8 as an additional hit dice. You gain
an additional d8 at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th level.

Additionally, If you drop to 0 hit points, you must be stabilized with an Intelligence (Engineering) or Intelligence (Electronics) check,
instead of a Wisdom (Medicine) check.
