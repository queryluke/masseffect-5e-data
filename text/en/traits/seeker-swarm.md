Seeker Swarm
As an action, you call three seeker swarms that orbit around you. The swarms remain for 1 hour or until you dismiss
them as a bonus action. While active, you may use a bonus action to expend one to three swarms that hit a creature
of your choice within 60 meters. A swarm deals 1d4 + 1 necrotic damage to its target and detonates any primed
condition (this damage bypasses shields). If you expend more than one swarm, they all strike simultaneously, and you
can direct them to hit one creature or several.

Once you use this feature, you must take a long rest before using it again.
