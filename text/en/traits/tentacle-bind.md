name: Tentacle Bind
---
When you attack a target with three or more tentacles simultaneously and hit, you can attempt to grapple the target as
a bonus action. You gain a +1 bonus to your Strength (Athletics) check for each tentacle used.

If you successfully grapple a creature with all six tentacles it becomes restrained until the grapple ends.
