name: Tentacles
---
You have six tentacles instead of arms that can grip tightly but can't lift anything heavier than a few kilograms.
You can only wield weapons with the _light_ property.

In addition, your tentacles are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you attack
with multiple tentacles simultaneously, gain a +1 bonus to the attack roll for each additional tentacle used.

When you hit with your tentacles, you deal 1d8 poison damage and the target must succeed on a
Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for one minute. The DC of this saving throw is equal to
10 + your proficiency bonus + the number of tentacles used on this attack.
