Due to their massive size, Elcor can only use one forelimb to use objects. You cannot wield more than one
weapon or object (such as a riot shield) at a time and you must stow your weapon to use items
(such as grenades and medi-gel) or interact with objects.

However, you ignore the heavy and two-handed property of all weapons and when you deal damage
with a weapon that has the versatile property, you deal damage as if you were attacking with two hands.
Additionally, you may cast powers while wielding a weapon.
