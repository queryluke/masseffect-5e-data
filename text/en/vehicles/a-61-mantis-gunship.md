name: A-61 Mantis Gunship
---
The Gunship is driven by vectored-thrust engines. First rolled off the assembly lines in 2170, the Mantis remains in
service in dozens of armies across the galaxy. Its modular construction means that the versatile Mantis can be
reconfigured as a low-altitude gunship, a fighter, a high-altitude bomber, or even a single-stage-to-orbit spaceplane
that can engage enemy craft around a planet or a space station. The only role the Mantis cannot perform is that of a true
deep-space fighter, as it has no FTL drive.

This vehicle statblock represents the most basic model of the A-61. But it can carry a number of weapons load-outs. When
used in ground-attack roles it is most commonly armed with two sets of two forward-facing missile bays over each wing,
normally armed with Inferno PKRs (Precision Kill Rockets), and a pair of belly-mounted M350 mass-accelerator autocannons.
