name: Inferno
---
The Inferno does not use thermal clips. Instead, use a d6 to track the "heat". Whenever you make a 
ranged attack with the weapon, spin down the die 1 face. Every round that you don't fire the weapon, 
spin the die up 1 face. If you ever spin down the die to 0, the weapon jams and cannot be fired 
again this combat.
