When you hit with an attack using this weapon, the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving 
throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 
hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.
