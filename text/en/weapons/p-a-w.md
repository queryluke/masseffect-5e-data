name: P.A.W.
---
The P.A.W. does not use thermal clips. Instead, use a d6 to track the "heat". Whenever you make a 
ranged attack with the weapon, spin down the die 1 face. Every round that you don't fire the weapon, 
spin the die up 1 face. If you ever spin down the die to 0, the weapon jams and cannot be fired 
again this combat.

After successfully hitting a target with a ranged attack with this weapon, you may use your bonus 
action to begin targeting. Until the targeting condition ends, you deal weapon damage to the target 
at each of the following combat phases: the end of your turn, the beginning of the target's turn, 
the end of the target's turn, and the beginning of your turn. Each time you deal damage, spin down 
your heat dice. In addition to standard targeting rules, this targeting condition can end when this 
weapon's heat becomes 0, when the targeted creature gains three-quarter or full cover, the target 
uses an action and succeeds on an opposed Dexterity check (you may add your proficiency bonus if you 
are proficient with this weapon type), or you use a bonus action on your turn to end the 
condition.
