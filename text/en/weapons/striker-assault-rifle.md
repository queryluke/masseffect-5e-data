name: Striker Assault Rifle

After making a ranged attack with the Striker, you may choose to enter the Targeting condition. At 
the start of your next turn, all ranged attacks made with the Striker deal an additional 1d12 
damage, at the cost of 2 heat per attack. This bonus continues to stack at the start of your turn 
until the targeting condition ends or until the Striker must be reloaded. For example, the 3rd round 
would deal 3d12 for 3 heat per attack, etc.
