  Relatively new to the market, the Mnemonic Visor is difficult to find outside
  Alliance space. Intended for biotic specialists, this headpiece plugs into the
  rest of the user's suit, gathering data so it can adapt to the wearer's
  tactics. It boosts biotic performance at critical moments to allow a soldier
  to perform with greater power than normally possible.
