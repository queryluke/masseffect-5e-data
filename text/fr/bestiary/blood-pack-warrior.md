      text: >-
        The warrior regains 4 hit points at the start of its turn. If the
        warrior takes fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of
        the warrior's next turn. The warrior dies only if it starts its turn
        with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

        When the warrior hits with its M-27 Scimitar, the target takes an
        additional 1d4 fire damage and becomes primed: fire until the end of the
        warrior's next turn.
