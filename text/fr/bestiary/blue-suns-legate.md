        As a bonus action, the legate can activate its Tech Armor. It
        immediately gains 30 temporary hit points. While the legate has at least
        1 of these temporary hit points remaining, it has +2 AC and resistance
        to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

        When the centurion hits with its M-76 Revenant or M-300 Claymore, the
        target takes an additional 1d4 fire damage and becomes primed: fire
        until the end of the legate's next turn.

        For 1 minute, the legate can utter a special command or warning whenever
        a non-hostile creature that it can see within <me-distance length='30'
        /> of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a
        d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the legate. A
        creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect
        ends if the legate is incapacitated.
