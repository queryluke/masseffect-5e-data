        As a bonus action, the legionnaire can activate its Tech Armor. It
        immediately gains 10 temporary hit points. While the legionnaire has at
        least 1 of these temporary hit points remaining, it has +2 AC.

        When the legionnaire hits with its M-15 Vindicator, if the target is
        primed, the target detonates. Otherwise, the target becomes primed:
        lightning until the end of the legionnaire's next turn.

        The legionnaire targets an area within <me-distance length="25" />. Each
        creature within <me-distance length="10" /> of the target must make a DC
        13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers 3d4 fire
        damage or half as much on a successful one. The area within a
        <me-distance length="10" adj /> radius, centered on the target continues
        to burn for 1 minute.


        A creature must also make the saving throw when it enters the burning
        space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.
