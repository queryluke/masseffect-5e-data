        The collector captain has advantage on an attack roll against a creature
        if at least one of the collector captain's allies is within <me-distance
        length='5' /> of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

        When the captain is possessed by a harbinger it gains temporary hit
        points equal to its total hit points and 8 barrier ticks. While it has
        barrier ticks it also gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and
        slashing damage. Instead of summoning a seaker swarm, it summons a
        seeker plague.

        For 1 minute, the collector captain can utter a special command or
        warning whenever a non-hostile creature that it can see within
        <me-distance length='30' /> of it makes an attack roll or a saving
        throw. The creature can add a d4 to its role provided it can hear and
        understand the collector captain. A creature can benefit from only one
        Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the collector captain is
        incapacitated.

      text: >-

        it can see within <me-distance length='30' />.
