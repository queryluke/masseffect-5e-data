        When the collector guardian is possessed by a harbinger it gains
        temporary hit points equal to its total hit points and 6 barrier ticks.
        While it has barrier ticks it also gains resistance to bludgeoning,
        piercing, and slashing damage.

        Successful ranged attacks on a target with an active barrier will strip
        away 2 barrier ticks and reduce the damage reduction by half. Warp ammo
        can detonate primed targets.
