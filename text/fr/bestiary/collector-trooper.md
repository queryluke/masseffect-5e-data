        temporary hit points equal to its total hit points and 6 barrier ticks.
        While it has barrier ticks it also gains resistance to bludgeoning,
        piercing, and slashing damage.

        The collector trooper targets an area within <me-distance length="25"
        />. Each creature within <me-distance length="10" /> of the target must
        make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes
        3d12 piercing damage or half as much damage on a successful one.
