        For 1 minute, the commando can utter a special command or warning
        whenever a non-hostile creature that it can see within <me-distance
        length="30" /> of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The
        creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand
        the commando. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a
        time. This effect ends if the commando is incapacitated.
