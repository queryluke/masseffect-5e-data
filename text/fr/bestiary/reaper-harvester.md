        The reaper harvester targets a location within <me-distance length='90'
        />. Each creature within a <me-distance length='15' /> radius must make
        a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save a creature takes 3d10 force
        and 3d10 thunder damage, or half as much damage on a successful one.
