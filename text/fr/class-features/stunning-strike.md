Starting at 6th level, you can focus your barrier into the impact of your charge power. When you hit a creature
with your charge cantrip, you can spend 1 barrier tick to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution
saving throw or be <me-condition id="stunned"/> until the end of your next turn.
