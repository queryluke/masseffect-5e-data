Starting at 18th level, you gain the ability to unleash a devastating combination of your allies' abilities. As a
bonus action, select up to five allies within <me-distance length="120" />. They can use their reactions to immediately take actions.

Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.
