title: Special Types of Movement
---
Movement through underground tunnels, skyscrapers, or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Operatives
might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.

### Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling
While climbing or swimming, each meter of movement costs <me-distance length="1" override="extra {metric}" />
(<me-distance length="2" override="extra {metric}" /> in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed.
At the GMâ€™s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics)
check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.

### Jumping
Your Strength determines how far you can jump.

__Long Jump__. When you make a long jump, you cover a number of <me-distance length="0" /> up to your Strength score<me-distance length="0" text-if="metric" override=" divided by three (rounded up)" />,
if you move at least <me-distance length="10" /> on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance.
Either way, each <me-distance length="0" adj /> you clear on the jump costs a <me-distance length="0" adj /> of movement.

This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM's option,
you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance),
such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.

When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.

__High Jump__. When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of <me-distance length="0" /> equal to 3 + your Strength
modifier<me-distance text-if="metric" length="0" override=" divided by three (rounded up)" /> if you move at least <me-distance length="10" />
on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can
jump only half that distance. Either way, each <me-distance length="0" adj /> you clear on the jump costs a <me-distance length="0" adj /> of movement. In some circumstances,
your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.

You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal
to the height of the jump plus 1 1/2 times your height.

### +/- Gravity <v-chip color="info" small>new</v-chip>
Operatives may find themselves in an environment with little, no, or increased gravity. Most species operate within a
1g environment, but some, such as elcor and some vorcha, can operate in higher-gravity environments without issue,
just as others (like a hanar with a working contra-gravitic decive) can operate in low-gravity environments without issue.
Alternatively, the operatives might have special devices that negate the effects of a low- or high-g environment. It's
up to the GM to decide the full effects of gravity on the operatives' movement.

__0g environments.__ When in a 0g environment, your speed becomes 0, unless you have a means of propelling yourself, like pushing
off of a surface. Unless you have a means of controlling your movement, you typically move in a straight line at a constant speed per round
unless some external force stops you or slows you down. Additional rules, such as disadvantage on Dexterity saving
throws or melee attacks are decided by the GM based on the context of your environment.

__Low-g environments.__ Generally speaking, when you're operating in a low-g environment, fall damage is halved, jump distances
are doubled and ignore terrain effects, but the entire environment is considered difficult terrain.

__High-g environments.__ Generally speaking, when you're operating in a high-g environment, fall damage is doubled, jump distances
are halved, and the environment is considered difficult terrain.
