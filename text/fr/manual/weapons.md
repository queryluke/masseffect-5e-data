title: Weapons
---
Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the weapons you are most likely to
use. Whether you favor an assault rifle or a sword, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the
difference between life and death while on a mission.

The [Weapons List](/weapons) shows the available weapons, their price and weight, the damage
they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged.
A melee weapon is used to attack a target within <me-distance length="5" /> of you, whereas a ranged weapon is used to attack a target at
a distance.

### Weapon Proficiency <v-chip color="warning" text-color="black" small>change</v-chip>
You must be proficient with a weapon type to add your proficiency modifier to the attack roll. There are 6 distinct weapon
types and all weapons fall into one of the following types.

- __Assault Rifles__. The most common weapons of the military. These are generally medium-range weapons that deal average damage with a high heat capacity.
- __Heavy Pistols__. The most common gun type in the Mass Effect universe. Simple but effective.
- __Sub-machine Guns (SMGs)__. Single-handed, rapid fire weapons that have a short range.
- __Shotguns__. Close-range, high-damage blasts.
- __Sniper Rifles__. Precision instruments meant for long range or stealthy combat.
- __Melee__. Used in close-quarters combat. _Damage resulting from melee weapon attacks by-pass shields_.

### Weapon Properties
Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons List.

See: [Appendix > Weapon Properties](/appendix/weapon-properties)

### Improvised Weapons
Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes
any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a crowbar, or the arm of a geth.

Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to
a club (melee weapon). At the GM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were
that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.

An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object).
If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property,
it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of <me-distance length="20" /> and a long range of <me-distance length="60" />.
Light improvised thrown weapons have ranges of <me-distance length="30" /> and <me-distance length="90" />, and heavy
improvised ranged weapons have ranges of <me-distance length="15" /> and <me-distance length="30" />.

### Thermal Clips <v-chip color="info" small>new</v-chip>
Ranged weapons (guns) use thermal clips to abate heat, requiring an action to load a new thermal clip into the weapon. More information
about reloading can be found in [Combat > Actions in Combat](/manual/combat#actions-in-combat).

### Carrying, Holstering, and Drawing Weapons <v-chip color="info" small>new</v-chip>
You have 4 weapon slots unless a feature or armor mod allows you to have more. __Two-handed__ weapons take up 2 slots.
If using the Variant: Encumbrance rule, you can carry as many weapons as your carry capacity will allow.

You can holster one weapon you're wielding or draw one weapon you're carrying as a free action. This is true for all weapon types.
However, to holster one weapon *then* draw a second weapon would require an action.
But the GM might allow a Sleight of Hand check to see if you can holster and draw at the cost of your bonus action.
