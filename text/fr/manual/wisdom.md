title: Wisdom

Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.

### Wisdom Checks

A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someoneâ€™s feelings, notice things about the
environment, or care for an injured person. The Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude
in certain kinds of Wisdom checks (see [Appendix > Skills](/appendix/skills)).

- __*Other Wisdom Checks*__. The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
  - Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow
  - Discern whether a seemingly life-like android is organic or synthetic

### Powercasting Ability
Adepts, vanguards, and sentinels use Wisdom as their powercasting ability, which helps determine the saving
throw DCs of powers they cast.
