Spin a field of dark energy originating from you in a <me-distance length="10" adj />-radius sphere. The field moves with you and reduces your walking
speed by half.

Each creature within the sphere must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 12d6 necrotic damage on a failed
save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make the saving throw when it enters the field's
space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

Any creature within the sphere is <me-condition id="primed" sub="necrotic"/>. This condition ends immediately if the creature leaves the sphere.

__At Higher Levels__: When you cast this power using a power slot of 5th level, increase the radius by <me-distance length="10" />.
