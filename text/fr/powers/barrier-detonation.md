Expend all of your remaining barrier ticks to create a negative mass effect field in a <me-distance length="5" adj/> sphere originating from you.
Each Medium or smaller creature or object within the sphere must succeed on Strength saving throw or becomes
<me-condition id="lifted"/> until the end of your next turn. If you expend at least 4 barrier ticks, Large targets must make
the saving throw. Creatures with at least 1 shield point have advantage on this saving throw.

Increase the range of the sphere by <me-distance length="5" /> at 5th level (<me-distance length="10" abbr/>), 11th level (<me-distance length="15" abbr/>), and 17th level (<me-distance length="20" abbr/>).
