The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during the power's duration, increase the density of the
weapon dealing an extra 2d8 force damage to the target. This damage detonates primed targets.

__At Higher Levels__: When you cast this power using a power slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage dealt by the
attack increases by 2d8 for each slot above the 1st.
