As an Attack action, you load and fire krogan-designed shells that burst into shrapnel upon impact. Choose a target location
within range. Each creature in a <me-distance length="10" adj />-radius sphere centered on the point of impact of the shell must make a Dexterity 
saving throw (DC 8 + proficiency bonus + DEX modifier). A target takes 2d6 piercing damage on a failed save, 
or half as much damage on a successful one.

You have 3 charges of Flak Cannon. You regain all of your charges on a long rest.

This feature's damage increases by 2d6 when you reach 5th level (4d6), 11th level (6d6), 17th level (8d6)
