Toss a portable shield generator onto the ground in front of you. It generates <me-distance length="5" adj/> tall and wide, hexagon-shaped shield
with 5 AC and 50 shield points.

As long as the Hex Shield has shield points, it provides full cover to creatures behind it.

Hex shield regains all shield points when you finish a long rest.
