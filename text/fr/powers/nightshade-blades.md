Your omni-tool is equipped with three microscopic, poison-tipped blades that are able to pierce through shields and armor.
Make a ranged weapon attack on a creature you can see within range, expending one blade. You add your proficiency bonus
to this roll. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 poison damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + proficiency bonus)
or becomes <me-condition id="poisoned"/> until it finishes a short rest. All damage caused by nightshade blades bypasses shields.

You must be within melee range and use an action to recover a blade, at which point you can reapply your poison and reload
it into your omni-tool during a short rest. If you fail to recover your blades, you can create 3 new ones for 1 hour of work
during a long rest.

This feature's damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), 17th level (4d12).
