Spend 5 shield points as you overload your shield capacitors causing a loud, kinetic wave to erupt in a <me-distance length="10" adj/>-radius
sphere centered on you. Each creature within the sphere becomes <me-condition id="deafened"/> and must
make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + proficiency bonus). On a failed save, a creature takes
2d8 psychic damage and is <me-condition id="stunned"/> until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature
takes half as much damage. Synthetic creatures have advantage on this saving throw.

The first time you use siege pulse, your armor suffers no adverse effect. If you use this power again before you
finish a short rest, roll a d20. On a 5 or lower you shields overload. You lose
all shield points, take 2d12 lightning damage, and cannot gain shield points unless you repair your armor. Each time you
use this feature again before finishing a short rest, you suffer a -5 penalty to the roll.

This feature's psychic damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (3d8), 11th level (4d8), 17th level (5d8).
