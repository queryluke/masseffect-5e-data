    name: Internal Bleeding
    text: The shifting causes internal bleeding. At the start of each of your turns, the target suffers 1d6 damage from blood loss, bypassing its shields. This effect ends if the creature uses medi-gel or if it or another creature passes a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check to stabilize the bleeding.

    name: Disorient
    text: A target hit by warp must pass a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the force of warp is so intense the target is stunned until the end of its next turn.

Make a ranged power attack on an organic creature you can see within range. On a hit, you generate a rapidly shifting mass
effect field inside the target dealing necrotic damage equal to 3d10 + your powercasting ability modifier. In addition,
the target is <me-condition id="primed" sub="necrotic"/> until the end of your next turn. This damage bypasses shields.

__At Higher Levels__: When you cast this power using a power slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 2d10 for
each slot level above the 2nd.
