Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. 
It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For 
example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, 
or hear operatives moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are 
obscured or easy to miss, whether they are husks lying in ambush in an ancient prothean ruin, 
mercenaries hiding in the shadows of an alley, or florescent light under a closed secret 
door.
