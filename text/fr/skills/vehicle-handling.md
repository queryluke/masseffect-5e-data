If you're driving a vehicle you're familiar with, the GM might ask you to make a Dexterity (Vehicle) 
check to make a difficult maneuver or avoid heavy weapon fire, crash land, or weave between traffic. 
 However, if you are unfamiliar with a vehicle, the GM would require a Wisdom (Vehicle Handling) 
check to see if you can pilot the vehicle at all.
