name: Collector Ship
---
A strange hybrid of an organic hive and metal, a Collector Ship carries the enigmatic Collectors, a species of
mysterious beings from beyond the Omega-4 Relay. Their technology is light years more advanced than anything in
the known galaxy, and their powerful ships are no exception.

__Multi-Attack__: A Collector Ship can make one _Main Cannon_ attack or three _Occular Cannon_ attacks once per turn.

__Special__: A Collector Ship's scanner is so advanced that ships integrated with a stealth drive do not gain the benefits
of the system, and the collector ship maybe detect them without disadvantage.


__Additional Systems__: The majority of the interior of these ships exist to store collection pods. They can be
large enough to fit an entire planet's worth of pods.
