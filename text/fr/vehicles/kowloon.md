name: Kowloon-class Carrier
---
Kowloon Class vessels are basic freighter starships originally designed (and mostly used) by humans. Each ship is
built on a standard design, likely for easy mass production. They generally carry a large cargo bay with smaller
compartments for additional passenger haulage, but their design means these compartments can be swapped or exchanged to
customize the ship.

Kowloon-class ships are hardy but carry no armaments and only a standard engine core. Unfortunately, this makes them easy
prey for privateers or mercenary bands looking for a quick score. Most are given the prefix 'MSV', for 'merchant space vehicle'.

__Additional Systems__: The Kowloon-class has 20 system slots. They vary widely and can be customized to fit the needs
of most businesses.

__Hanger__: Kowloon-class carriers can be equipped with a hanger (taking up 5 system slots). The hanger can hold up to
20 interceptors or fighters.
