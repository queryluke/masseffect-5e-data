name: Reaper Capital Ship
---
Also known as Sovereign-class, the two-kilometer-long Capital Ships are the most well-known Reaper subtype. Their main
weapon is a spinal mounted "magnetohydrodynamic" cannon with a yield of 132 to 450 kilotons of TNT, which dwarfs the
main gun of an Everest-class Alliance dreadnought. No known ship, not even a dreadnought, has been known to survive a
hit from this weapon.

__Occulus Drones (Recharge 6)__. The Reaper Capital Ship can summon 1d10 Occulus Drones.
