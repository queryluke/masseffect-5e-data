Destroyers are a type of Reaper that appear during their galaxy-wide invasion in 2186. They are approximately <me-distance length="400" />
in height; smaller than a Reaper of Sovereign's class, which measure over two kilometers in height. Destroyers make up
the majority of the Reaper fleet and are believed to be created using harvested species that are not used to
build Reaper Capital Ships.
