Instead of making a ranged weapon attack, the target makes a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 + DEX 
modifier). Do not add your DEX modifier to a Double Tap attack. If you are proficient with Assault 
Rifles, add your proficiency bonus to the DC. On a failed save, the target takes 1d8 thunder damage, 
or half as much on a successful one.
